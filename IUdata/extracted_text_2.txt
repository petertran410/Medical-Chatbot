GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 VCONTENTSThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2is a medical ref-erence product designed to inform and educate readersabout a wide variety of disorders, conditions, treatments,and diagnostic tests. The Gale Group believes the productto be comprehensive, but not necessarily definitive. It isintended to supplement, not replace, consultation with aphysician or other healthcare practitioner. While the GaleGroup has made substantial efforts to provide informationthat is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date, the GaleGroup makes no representations or warranties of anykind, including without limitation, warranties of mer-chantability or fitness for a particular purpose, nor does itguarantee the accuracy, comprehensiveness, or timelinessof the information contained in this product. Readersshould be aware that the universe of medical knowledgeis constantly growing and changing, and that differencesof medical opinion exist among authorities. Readers arealso advised to seek professional diagnosis and treatmentfor any medical condition, and to discuss informationobtained from this book with their health care provider.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 VIIPLEASE READ—IMPORTANT INFORMATIONThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 (GEM2)is a one-stop source for medical information on nearly 1,700common medical disorders, conditions, tests, and treat-ments, including high-profile diseases such as AIDS,Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and heart attack. This ency-clopedia avoids medical jargon and uses language thatlaypersons can understand, while still providing thor-ough coverage of each topic. The Gale Encyclopedia ofMedicine 2fills a gap between basic consumer healthresources, such as single-volume family medical guides,and highly technical professional materials.
SCOPE
Almost 1,700 full-length articles are included in theGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2, including disorders/conditions, tests/procedures, and treatments/therapies.Many common drugs are also covered, with generic drugnames appearing first and brand names following inparentheses, eg. acetaminophen (Tylenol). Throughoutthe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2, many prominentindividuals are highlighted as sidebar biographies thataccompany the main topical essays. Articles follow astandardized format that provides information at aglance. Rubrics include:Disorders/Conditions Tests/TreatmentsDefinition DefinitionDescription PurposeCauses and symptoms PrecautionsDiagnosis DescriptionTreatment PreparationAlternative treatment AftercarePrognosis RisksPrevention Normal/Abnormal resultsResources ResourcesKey terms Key termsIn recent years there has been a resurgence of interestin holistic medicine that emphasizes the connectionbetween mind and body. Aimed at achieving and main-taining good health rather than just eliminating disease,this approach has come to be known as alternative medi-cine. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2includes anumber of essays on alternative therapies, ranging fromtraditional Chinese medicine to homeopathy and frommeditation to aromatherapy. In addition to full essays onalternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specificAlternative treatmentsections for diseases and condi-tions that may be helped by complementary therapies.INCLUSION CRITERIA
A preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-ments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,including professional medical guides and textbooks aswell as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The generaladvisory board, made up of public librarians, medicallibrarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-ics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sortedby category and sent to GEM2medical advisors, certifiedphysicians with various medical specialities, for review.Final selection of topics to include was made by the med-ical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.
ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS
The essays were compiled by experienced medicalwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, andother health care professionals. GEM2medical advisorsreviewed the completed essays to insure that they areappropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.

Abdominal ultrasound
Definition
Ultrasound technology allows doctors to “see”inside a patient without resorting to surgery. A transmit-ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,where they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer, which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.
Purpose
The potential medical applications of ultrasoundwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-ty had improved to the point that it came into generalmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its lowcost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into thetop drawer of medical imaging techniques.While pelvic ultrasoundis widely known and com-monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy, ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominalimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizingradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better thanplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of softtissue structures, and can be used in any of severalmodes, depending on the need at hand.As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generallyis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acuteabdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-pected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-creatic disease,gallstones, spleen disease, kidney dis-ease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominalaortic aneurysm. Specifically:• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain cansignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction orinjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasoundscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-tial causes when presented with general or ambiguoussymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can bestudied for signs of disease that appear as changes insize, shape and internal structure.• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as acar crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injuredabdominal organs is often the most serious threat tosurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding areimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as aninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and itcan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severityof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds,f r o m a bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreignobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-nology has brought it into common emergency roomuse, and even into limited ambulance service.• Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths—tumors, cysts,abscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs—can beA
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 1located and tentatively identified with ultrasound. Inparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can bedistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts andabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ orpart of the abdomen can be found.• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liverdisease are numerous, though jaundicetends to be ageneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate betweenmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, andis particularly good at identifying obstruction of thebile ducts and cirrhosis, which is characterized byabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation ofthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as arepancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt properfunctioning.• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissionsthan any other digestive malady. These calculi cancause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and alsoobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymesfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone toinjury during abdominal trauma. It may also becomepainfully inflamed when beset with infection orcancer. These conditions also lend themselves well toultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumaticinjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,which can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi- soning(uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinctchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-plete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has provenextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weakspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blooddirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. Theseaneurysms are relatively common and increase inprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-nently life-threatening. However, they can be readilyidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acutecomplications result.Ultrasound technology can also be used for treat-ment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid duringsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placementto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells forbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications forultrasound are being developed.The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves liesin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just likeaudible sound, and vibrate the materials through whichthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-able at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound canbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.High-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treatsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associatedscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound canalso be used to physically destroy certain types oftumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound isan active area of medical research.
Precautions
Properly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtuallywithout risk or side effects. Some patients report feelinga slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, butmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriatefrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-vate any medical condition, though any woman whothinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue withher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,however, depends greatly on the quality of the equipmentused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound canbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem existswhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment canperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patientsshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as thequality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-posed procedure.In cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,patients should educate themselves about the proposedprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominalultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may behampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, suchas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaqueto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are oftennot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.
Description
Ultrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-quency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, orcycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-quencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2KEY TERMS
Accessory organ—A lump of tissue adjacent to anorgan that is similar to it, but which serves noimportant purpose, if functional at all. While notnecessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob-lems if they grow too large or become cancerous. Inany case, their presence points to an underlyingabnormality in the parent organ.Benign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite ofmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that isstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.Biopsy—The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-sue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, theterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissuefrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.Calculus—Any type of hard concretion (stone) inthe body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-creas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-lation of excess mineral salts and other organicmaterial such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) cancause problems by lodging in and obstructing theproper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines orurine to the bladder.Cirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized bythe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-tion of proper functioning—jaundice is often anaccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis includealcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-tive heart disease.Common bile duct—The branching passagethrough which bile—a necessary digestiveenzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder intothe small intestine. Digestive enzymes from thepancreas also enter the intestines through the com-mon bile duct.Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special-ized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focusedand relatively low energy radiation to producedetailed two-dimensional images of soft tissuestructures, particularly the brain. CT scans are thechief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higherquality images not disrupted by bone or gas. Theyare, however, more cumbersome, time consumingand expensive to perform, and they use ionizingelectromagnetic radiation.Doppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparentchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returningto a stationary source from a moving target. If theobject is moving toward the source, the frequencyincreases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can beused to compute the object’s speed—be it a car onthe road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effectholds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.Frequency—Sound, whether traveling through airor the human body, produces vibrations—mole-cules bouncing into each other—as the shock wavetravels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-ber of vibrations per second. Within the audiblerange, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-quency, the higher a sound’s pitch.Ionizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv-ing tissue by disrupting and destroying individualcells at the molecular level. All types of nuclearradiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—arepotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibratethe material through which they pass, but do notionize it.Jaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tintto the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention inthe liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediatecause, but the underlying cause could be as simpleas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-stone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasoundcan distinguish between these conditions.Malignant—The term literally means growing worseand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym forcancerous and connotes a harmful condition thatgenerally is life-threatening.Morphology—Literally, the study of form. In medi-cine, morphology refers to the size, shape andstructure rather than the function of a given organ.As a diagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facil-itates the recognition of abnormal morphologies assymptoms of underlying conditions.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 3Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce moredetailed images, but are also more readily absorbed andso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominalultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequenciesbetween 2-5 MHz.An ultrasound machine consists of two parts: thetransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both producesthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives thereflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity thatis produced when you put pressure on certain crystalssuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-es by producing sound waves ( they are transmittingwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electricpulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce thescanning sound waves. The transducer then receives thereturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulsesand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-nizes the data into an image on a television screen.Because sound waves travel through all the body’stissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles perhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to bereceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into thebody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of thespecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can beplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, theechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surroundedby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines andbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because thewaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med-ical imaging:• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound inwhich a single transducer scans a line through the bodywith the echoes plotted on screen as a function ofdepth. This method is used to measure distances withinthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeuticultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is alsoA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of thedestructive wave energy.• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the bodythat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image onscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100transducers in sequence form the basis for these mostcommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequenceof B-mode scans whose images follow each other insequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries thatproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to particular use instudying heart motion.• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonographyincludes thecapability of accurately measuring velocities of movingmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measurethe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability ismost often combined with B-mode scanning to produceimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can bedirectly measured. This technique is used extensively toinvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper- tension, particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-inal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. Thesemachines cost about $250,000.The actual procedure for a patient undergoing anabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless ofthe type of scan or its purpose. Fastingfor at least eighthours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach isempty and as small as possible, and that the intestinesand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows thegall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating andmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, afull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the wayso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gelthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across theskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.This procedure is conducted by a doctor with theassistance of a technologist skilled in operating theequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen toobtain different views of the target areas. The patient willlikely be asked to change positions from side to side andto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desiredviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.The many types and uses of ultrasound technologymakes it difficult to generalize about the time and costsinvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aorticaneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform andwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending onthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-modeand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targetsnot well defined in advance, generally take more timeand are more expensive.Regardless of the type of scan used and the potentialdifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster andless expensive than computed tomography scans(CT), its primary rival in abdominal imaging. Furthermore, asabdominal ultrasounds are generally undertaken as“medically necessary” procedures designed to detect thepresence of suspected abnormalities, they are covered
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 4Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 4under most types of major medical insurance. As always,though, the patient would be wise to confirm that theircoverage extends to the specific procedure proposed. Fornonemergency situations, most underwriters stipulateprior approval as a condition of coverage.Specific conditions for which ultrasound may beselected as a treatment option—certain types of tumors,lesions,kidney stonesand other calculi, muscle and lig-ament injuries, etc.—are described in detail under theappropriate entries in this encyclopedia.
Preparation
A patient undergoing abdominal ultrasound will beadvised by their physician about what to expect and howto prepare. As mentioned above, preparations generallyinclude fasting and arriving for the procedure with a fullbladder, if necessary. This preparation is particularly use-ful if the gallbladder, ovaries or veins are to be examined.
Aftercare
In general, no aftercare related to the abdominalultrasound procedure itself is required.
Risks
Abdominal ultrasound carries with it no recognizedrisks or side effects, if properly performed using appropri-ate frequency and intensity ranges. Sensitive tissues, par-ticularly those of the reproductive organs, could possiblysustain damage if violently vibrated by overly intenseultrasound waves. In general though, such damage wouldonly result from improper use of the equipment.Any woman who thinks she might be pregnantshould raise this issue with her doctor before undergoingan abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early stages ofdevelopment could be injured by ultrasound meant toprobe deeply recessed abdominal organs.
Normal results
As a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal abdom-inal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence of thesuspected condition that prompted the scan. For example,symptoms such as a persistent cough, labored breathing,and upper abdominal pain suggest the possibility of,among other things, an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Anultrasound scan that indicates the absence of an aneurysmwould rule out this life-threatening condition and point toother, less serious causes.
Abnormal results
Because abdominal ultrasound imaging is generallyundertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the resultsof a scan often will prove abnormal—that is they willconfirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis ofthe liver or an aortic aneurysm. At that point, appropriatemedical treatment as prescribed by a patient’s doctor is inorder. See the relevant disease and disorder entries in thisencyclopedia for more information.ResourcesBOOKS

Abdominal wall defects
Definition
Abdominal wall defects are birth (congenital)defects that allow the stomach or intestines to protrude.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 5Abdominal wall defectsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 5Description
Many unexpected and fascinating events occur dur-ing the development of a fetus inside the womb. Thestomach and intestines begin development outside thebaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wallenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical openingis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through theabdominal wall.
Causes and symptoms
There are many causes for birth defectsthat still remain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal walldefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother mayhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetusare nondescript.
Diagnosis
At birth, the problem is obvious, because the base ofthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worsecases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, anultrasound examination may detect the problem. It isalways necessary in children with one birth defect to lookfor others, because birth defects are usually multiple.
Treatment
Abdominal wall defects are effectively treated withsurgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.The organs are normal, just misplaced. However, if thedefect is large, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera intothe small abdominal cavity.
Prognosis
If there are no other defects, the prognosis after sur-gical repair of this condition is relatively good. However,KEY TERMS
Hernia—Movement of a structure into a place itdoes not belong.Umbilical—Referring to the opening in theabdominal wall where the blood vessels from theplacenta enter.Viscera—Any of the body’s organs located in thechest or abdomen.10% of those with more severe or additional abnormali-ties die from it. The organs themselves are fully function-al; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen.The condition is, in fact, a herniarequiring only replace-ment and strengthening of the passageway throughwhich it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure inthe stretched abdomen can compromise the function ofthe organs inside.
Prevention
Some, but by no means all, birth defects are pre-ventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good nutri- tion, supplemental vitamins, diligent avoidance of allunnecessary drugs and chemicals—especially tobacco—and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.Resources

Abortion, partial birth
Definition
Partial birth abortion is a method of late-term abor-tion that terminates a pregnancyand results in the death and intact removal of a fetus. This procedure is mostcommonly referred to as intact dilatation and extraction(D & X).
Purpose
Partial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to end apregnancy and results in the death of a fetus, typically in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 6Abortion, partial birthGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 6the late second or third trimester. Although D&X is high-ly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-tages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-stances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus isremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation andautopsyof the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.Intact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower riskof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Anotherperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancywithout requiring the woman to go through labor, whichmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods oflate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lowercost and shorter procedure time.
Precautions
Women considering D&X should be aware of thehighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-versy common to all late-term abortions is whether thefetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’sbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is thatfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetalbody has exited the uterus. Several states have takenlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicianswho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This mayrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-ing late-term abortion.
Description
Intact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involvesadministration of medications to cause the cervix todilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, thephysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feetfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base ofthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, thecontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,which results in the death of the fetus, and reduces thesizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass throughthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is thenremoved from the woman’s body.
Preparation
Medical preparation for D&X involves an outpatientvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria,t o cause the cervix to begin dilating.In addition, preparation may involve fulfilling locallegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,counseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewingstages of fetal development,childbirth, alternative abor-tion methods, and adoption.KEY TERMS
Cervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus thatseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.Footling breech—A position of the fetus while inthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearestthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exitthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the lastpart to exit the uterus.Laminaria—A medical product made from a cer-tain type of seaweed that is physically placed nearthe cervix to cause it to dilate.
Aftercare
D&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-tal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled tomonitor the woman for any complications.
Risks
With all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortionis performed, the more complicated the procedure andthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition toassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk ofinjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, bloodclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a riskof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is notdead when removed from the woman’s body. Possiblelong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant orcarrying a future pregnancy to term.
Normal results
The expected outcome of D&X is the termination ofa pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from thewoman’s body.Resources

Abortion, selective
Definition
Selective abortion, also known as selective reduc-tion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in amulti-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to themother in carrying and giving birth to more than one ortwo babies, and also to decrease the risk of complicationsto the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortionalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such asthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be bornwith some birth defect or impairment, or because the sexof the fetus is not preferred by the individual.
Purpose
A woman may decide to abort for health reasons, forexample, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-nancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.However, selective reduction is recommended often incases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more thanone fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In thegeneral population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in onlyabout 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-cies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.
Precautions
Because women or couples who use fertility drugshave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-ble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-able with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-ment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetalpregnancy and consider the prospect of recommendedreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.
Description
Selective reduction is usually performed betweennine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successfulwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-dure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-dle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina andpotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.
Preparation
Individuals who have chosen selective reduction tosafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseledprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy toboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risksafter the reduction.Individuals seeking an abortion for any reasonshould consider the ethical implications whether it bebecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because thefetus would be born with a severe birth defect.
Aftercare
Counseling should continue after the abortionbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feelguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mentalhealth professionals should be consulted throughout theprocess.
Risks
About 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-tion will go into premature labor. About 4-5% ofwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry oneor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associatedwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.
Normal results
In cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three ormore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typicallydevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.Resources

Abortion, therapeutic
Definition
Therapeutic abortion is the intentional terminationof a pregnancybefore the fetus can live independently.Abortion has been a legal procedure in the United Statessince 1973.
Purpose
An abortion may be performed whenever there issome compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Womenhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy wouldcause them hardship, endanger their life or health, orbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will beborn with severe abnormalities.Abortions are safest when performed within the firstsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-culation of this date is referred to as the gestational ageand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. Forexample, a woman who is two weeks late having herperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is sixweeks since she last menstruated.About 90% of women who have abortions do sobefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higherKEY TERMS
Multi-fetal pregnancy—A pregnancy of two ormore fetuses.Selective reduction—Typically referred to in casesof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetusesare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-ing fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.rate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks areextremely rare and are usually limited to situations wherethe life of the mother is in danger.
Precautions
Most women are able to have abortions at clinics oroutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early inpregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlledepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or whoare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatientsif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-vious endocarditis,asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter-ine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-trolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usuallyneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-toring and medications during the procedure.
Description
V ery early abortionsBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can beended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. Thisprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,mini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastictube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suctionis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.Another method is called the “morning after” pill, oremergency contraception. Basically, it involves takinghigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours ofhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormonescauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-port a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it issimply expelled from the body.There are two types of emergency contraception.One type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, anduses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type isavailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-ven. But women can even use their regular birth controlpills for emergency contraception, after they check withtheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of womenwho use birth control pills for emergency contraceptionget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts therisk of pregnancy 75 percent.The other type of morning-after pill contains onlyone hormone: progestin, and is available under the brandname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type witha lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the riskof pregnancy 89 percent.Women should check with their physicians regard-ing the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9Abortion, therapeuticGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9brand of birth control pill. Not all birth control pills willwork for emergency contraception.Menstrual extractions are safe, but because theamount of fetal material is so small at this stage of devel-opment, it is easy to miss. This results in an incompleteabortion that means the pregnancy continues.First trimester abortionsThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13weeks after the last menstrual period. In the UnitedStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during thisperiod. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,and the time in which women have the most choice ofhow the procedure is performed.
MEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are broughtabout by taking medications that end the pregnancy. Theadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instrumentsare used.• Anesthesia is not required.• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.Disadvantages of a medical abortion are:• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-gical abortion.• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it isexpelled.Two different medications can be used to bring aboutan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.On the first visit to the doctor, the woman receivesan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, abouta week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), anoxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible forvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of theuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel thecontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that theabortion is complete.With this procedure, a woman will feel crampingand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. Thiscombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in endingpregnancy.Mifepristone(RU-486), which goes by the brandname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending thepregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after thefirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit tothe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two dayslater she returns and, if the miscarriage has notoccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes theuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need totake misoprostol. After an observation period, shereturns home.Within four days, 90% of women have expelled thecontents of their uterus and completed the abortion.Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed theabortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound thatthe procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, asurgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusionafter taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists inabout 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortionis recommended because the fetus may be damanged.Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavycramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor-mal period and may last up to 16 days.Mifepristone is not recommended for women withectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long-

Between 5 and 7 weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a pro-cedure called menstrual extraction.The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin extraction tube thatis inserted through the undilated cervix.

The procedure is also calleddilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-um curettage, or suction curettage.Advantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.• The woman does not see the products of her wombbeing removed.Disadvantages include:• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.• Infection may occur.During a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix isgradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into thecervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-tion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-tents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a womanfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is oftengiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterinecramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman mayreturn home.Second trimester abortionsAlthough it is better to have an abortion during thefirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may beinevitable. The results of genetic testingare often notavailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especiallyteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come toterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a firsttrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-ing second trimester abortions.Some second trimester abortions are performed as aD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in thefirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be usedbecause more material must be removed. This increasesthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increasesthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctantto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for somewomen is it not a medically safe option.The alternative to a D & E in the second trimester isan abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may requirean overnight stay in a hospital. The day before the proce-dure, the woman visits the doctor for tests, and to eitherKEY TERMS

Anesthesia of the sort used inchildbirthcan be given to mask the pain. Many womenare able to go home a few hours after the procedure.Very early abortions cost between $200-$400. Laterabortions cost more. The cost increases about $100 perweek between the thirteenth and sixteenth week. Secondtrimester abortions are much more costly because theyoften involve more risk, more services, anesthesia, andsometimes a hospital stay. Insurance carriers and HMOsmay or may not cover the procedure. Federal law pro-

Preparation
The doctor must know accurately the stage of awoman’s pregnancy before an abortion is performed. Thedoctor will ask the woman questions about her menstrualcycle and also do a physical examinationto confirm thestage of pregnancy. This may be done at an office visitbefore the abortion or on the day of the abortion. Somestates require a waiting period before an abortion can beperformed. Others require parental or court consent for achild under age 18 to receive an abortion.Despite the fact that almost half of all women in theUnited States have had at least one abortion by the timethey reach age 45, abortion is surrounded by controversy.Women often find themselves in emotional turmoil whendeciding if an abortion is a procedure they wish to under-go. Pre-abortion counseling is important in helping awoman resolve any questions she may have about havingthe procedure.
Aftercare
Regardless of the method used to perform the abor-tion, a woman will be observed for a period of time tomake sure her blood pressure is stable and that bleedingis controlled. The doctor may prescribe antibioticsto reduce the chance of infection. Women who are Rh nega-tive (lacking genetically determined antigens in their redblood cells that produce immune responses) should begiven a human Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) after theprocedure unless the father of the fetus is also Rh nega-tive. This prevents blood incompatibility complicationsin future pregnancies.Bleeding will continue for about five days in a surgicalabortion and longer in a medical abortion. To decrease therisk of infection, a woman should avoid intercourse and notuse tampons and douches for two weeks after the abortion.A follow-up visit is a necessary part of the woman’saftercare. Contraception will be offered to women whowish to avoid future pregnancies, because menstrualperiods normally resume within a few weeks.
Risks
Serious complications resulting from abortions per-formed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of womenwho have abortions in this time period, 2.5% have minorcomplications that can be handled without hospitaliza-tion. Less than 0.5% have complications that require ahospital stay. The rate of complications increases as thepregnancy progresses.Complications from abortions can include:• uncontrolled bleeding• infection• blood clots accumulating in the uterus• a tear in the cervix or uterus• missed abortion where the pregnancy continues• incomplete abortion where some material from thepregnancy remains in the uterusWomen who experience any of the following symp-toms of post-abortion complications should call the clin-ic or doctor who performed the abortion immediately.• severe pain• fever over 100.4°F (38.2°C)• heavy bleeding that soaks through more than one sani-tary pad per hour• foul-smelling discharge from the vagina• continuing symptoms of pregnancyNormal results
Usually the pregnancy is ended without complica-tion and without altering future fertility.Resources

Abscess
Definition
An abscess is an enclosed collection of liquefied tis-sue, known as pus, somewhere in the body. It is the resultof the body’s defensive reaction to foreign material.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 12AbcessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 12Description
There are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are theresult of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immuneresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,white blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest bodytissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,and enzymes.An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection thatbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, asthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,several events occur:• Blood flow to the area increases.• The temperature of the area increases due to theincreased blood supply.• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,and other liquids.• It turns red.• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling andthe chemical activity.These four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—characterize inflammation.As the process progresses, the tissue begins to turnto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easilydigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-toms just like any other infection. These include chills,fever, aching, and general discomfort.Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of thesame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterileabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps asthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.
Causes and symptoms
Many different agents cause abscesses. The mostcommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria likeStaphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the causeof abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the largebowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused byany of the numerous bacteria found within the largebowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be causedby any organism that can travel there through the circula-tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel inthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body arecaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-tures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-ic abscesses are:• skin abscesses by normal skin flora• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora• lung abscesses by normal airway flora,pneumoniagerms, or tuberculosis• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel floraSpecific types of abscessesListed below are some of the more common andimportant abscesses.• Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceousglands) on the back or the back of the neck are the onesusually infected. The most common germ involved isStaphylococcus aureus. Acneis a similar condition ofsebaceous glands on the face and back.• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect atiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac-teria can enter this opening, causing an infection andsubsequent abscess.

These abscesses can com-promise swallowing and even breathing.• Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether it’sdue to bacteria [common pneumonia], tuberculosis,fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can developas a complication.• Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestinescan spread through the blood to the liver and causeabscesses.• Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen oneither side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles.They flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one ofthese muscles, usually when it spreads from the appen-dix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes.
Diagnosis
The common findings of inflammation—heat, red-ness, swelling, and pain—easily identify superficialabscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce onlygeneralized symptoms such as fever and discomfort. Ifthe patient’s symptoms and physical examinationdo not help, a physician may have to resort to a battery of tests toKEY TERMS

Recent or chronic dis-ease in an organ suggests it may be the site of an abscess.Dysfunction of an organ or system—for instance, seizuresor altered bowel function—may provide the clue. Pain and tenderness on physical examination are commonfindings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-nel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterileabscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-tock where a shot was given.
Treatment
Since skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,it acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals ofan abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,the pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.The surgeon determines when the abscess is ready fordrainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing thepus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaininginfection, sometimes with the help of antibioticsor other drugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth orrubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closingbefore all the pus has drained out.
Alternative treatment
If an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will beslowly working its way through the skin as it is morerapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicalswork faster at higher temperatures, applications of hotcompresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten thedigestion of the skin and eventually result in its breakingdown, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment isbest reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-gerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.It is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their veryearly stages. It will “ripen” them.Contrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and coldcompresses, can also help assist the body in resorption ofthe abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies thatwork to rebalance the body in relation to abscess forma-tion,Silicaand Hepar sulphuris. In cases of septicabscesses, bentonite clay packs (bentonite clay and asmall amount of Hydrastispowder) can be used to drawthe infection from the area.
Prognosis
Once the abscess is properly drained, the prognosisis excellent for the condition itself. The reason for theabscess (other diseases the patient has) will determinethe overall outcome. If, on the other hand, the abscessruptures into neighboring areas or permits the infectious
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 14AbcessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 14agent to spill into the bloodstream, serious or fatal conse-quences are likely. Abscesses in and around the nasalsinuses, face, ears, and scalp may work their way into thebrain. Abscesses within an abdominal organ such as theliver may rupture into the abdominal cavity. In eithercase, the result is life threatening. Blood poisoningis a term commonly used to describe an infection that hasspilled into the blood stream and spread throughout thebody from a localized origin. Blood poisoning, known tophysicians as septicemia, is also life threatening.Of special note, abscesses in the hand are more seri-ous than they might appear. Due to the intricate structureand the overriding importance of the hand, any handinfection must be treated promptly and competently.
Prevention
Infections that are treated early with heat (if superfi-cial) or antibiotics will often resolve without the forma-tion of an abscess. It is even better to avoid infectionsaltogether by taking prompt care of open injuries, partic-ularly puncture wounds. Bites are the most dangerous ofall, even more so because they often occur on the hand.Resources

Abscess incision & drainage
Definition
An infected skin nodule that contains pus may need tobe drained via a cut if it does not respond to antibiotics. This allows the pus to escape, and the infection to heal.
Purpose
An abscessis a pus-filled sore, usually caused by abacterial infection. The pus is made up of both live anddead organisms and destroyed tissue from the whiteblood cells that were carried to the area to fight the infec-tion. Abscesses are often found in the soft tissue underthe skin, such as the armpit or the groin. However, theymay develop in any organ, and are commonly found inthe breast and gums. Abscesses are far more serious andcall for more specific treatment if they are located indeep organs such as the lung, liver or brain.Because the lining of the abscess cavity tends tointerfere with the amount of the drug that can penetratethe source of infection from the blood, the cavity itselfmay require draining. Once an abscess has fully formed,it often does not respond to antibiotics. Even if theantibiotic does penetrate into the abscess, it doesn’t func-tion as well in that environment.
Precautions
An abscess can usually be diagnosed visually, al-though an imaging technique such as a computed tomog-raphy scan may be used to confirm the extent of theabscess before drainage. Such procedures may also beneeded to localize internal abscesses, such as those in theabdominal cavity or brain.

A doctor will cut into the lining of the abscess, allow-ing the pus to escape either through a drainage tube or byleaving the cavity open to the skin. How big the incisionis depends on how quickly the pus is encountered.Once the abscess is opened, the doctor will cleanand irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline. If it is nottoo large or deep, the doctor may simply pack theabscess wound with gauze for 24–48 hours to absorb thepus and discharge.If it is a deeper abscess, the doctor may insert adrainage tube after cleaning out the wound. Once the tube isin place, the surgeon closes the incision with simple stitch-es, and applies a sterile dressing. Drainage is maintained forseveral days to help prevent the abscess from reforming.
Preparation
The skin over the abscess will be cleansed by swab-bing gently with an antiseptic solution.
Aftercare
Much of the painaround the abscess will be goneafter the surgery. Healing is usually very fast. After thetube is taken out, antibiotics may be continued for sever-al days. Applying heat and keeping the affected area ele-vated may help relieve inflammation.
Risks
If there is any scarring, it is likely to become muchless noticeable as time goes on, and eventually almostinvisible. Occasionally, an abscess within a vital organ(such as the brain) damages enough surrounding tissuethat there is some permanent loss of normal function.
Normal results
Most abscesses heal after drainage alone; othersrequire drainage and antibiotic drug treatment.Resources

Abuse
Definition
Abuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-ous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive andwrongful misuse of anything. There are several major typesof abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,substance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.
Description
Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury byan other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result inbruises,burns,poisoning, broken bones, and internalhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarilyoccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-lence. It is estimated that approximately three millionchildren witness domestic violence every year.Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behaviorbetween an adult and child or between two children, oneof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexualbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can alsoinclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.Pornographic photography is also used in sexualabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-caresettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by afemale with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-fathers is five times more common than with biologicalfathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers orfathers is the most common form of incest.Sexual abuse can also take the form of rape. Thelegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by useof drugs).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 16AbuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 16• mental impairment renders the victim incapable ofrational judgment.• if the victim is below the legal age established for con-sent.Substance abuse is an abnormal pattern of substanceusage leading to significant distress or impairment. Thecriteria include one or more of the following occurringwithin a 12-month period:• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfillobligations at home, work, or school.• using substance in situations that are physically danger-ous (i.e., while driving).• recurrent substance-related legal problems.• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-sonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-cant other).Abuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostlyas a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level ofdependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abusecan be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delayingor not reporting the need for advanced medical care.Elderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (moneyor possessions taken away) and abandonment.Emotional abuse generally continues even after phys-ical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personallytailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-it a provoked response.
Causes and symptoms
Children who have been abused usually have a varietyof symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, andpsychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-cally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,depressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, theyexhibit fear,anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychologicalproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumaticstressdisorder. Physically abused children may complainof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. Theymay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-dren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexualbehavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.Adolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,and—in some situations—homosexual contact.Physical abuse directed towards adults can ultimatelylead to death. Approximately 50% of women murderedin the United States were killed by a former or currentmale partner. Approximately one-third of emergencyroom consultations by women were prompted due todomestic violence. Female victims who are married alsohave a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-KEY TERMS
Encopresis—Abnormalities relating to bowel move-ments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.ness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).Physical abuse or rape can also occur between marriedpersons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-ally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, anddebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-lence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-ually assaulted persons were also physically abused in theform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim witha weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who arehurt and humiliated tend to physical assault personswhom they are intimately involved with, such as spousesand/or children. Males who assault a female tend to haveexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directedagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor thewomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolateother sources of protection and support. They interprettheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-ment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-ing control. Males may also use aggression againstfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.Abuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderlycommunity. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-taker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-ing behavioral changes in the elderly person when thecaretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can bepossible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,inconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack ofhygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.
Diagnosis
Children who are victims of domestic violence arefrequently injured attempting to protect their motherfrom an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspectionor self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also beevident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises orself report.Sexual abuse of both a child and an adult can bediagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can beassessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator.Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth,rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis-easesmay be performed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 17AbuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 17Elderly abuse can be suspected if the elderly patientdemonstrates a fear from the caretaker. Additionally,elderly abuse can be suspected if there are signs indicat-ing intentional delay of required medical care or achange in medical status.Substance abuse can be suspected in a person whocontinues to indulge in their drug of choice despite recur-rent negative consequences. The diagnosis can be madeafter administration of a comprehensive bio-psycho-social exam and standardized chemical abuse assess-ments by a therapist.
Treatment
Children who are victims of physical or sexual abusetypically require psychological support and medical atten-tion. A complaint may be filed with the local family socialservices that will initiate investigations. The authoritieswill usually follow up the allegation or offense. Childrenmay also be referred for psychological evaluation and/ortreatment. The victim may be placed in foster care pendingthe investigation outcome. The police may also investigatephysical and sexual abuse of an adult. The victim mayrequire immediate medical care and long-term psychologi-cal treatment. It is common for children to be adverselyaffected by domestic violence situations and the local fam-ily services agency may be involved.Substance abusers should elect treatment, either inpa-tient or outpatient, depending on severity of addiction. Long term treatment and/or medications may be utilized toassist in abstinence. The patient should be encouraged toparticipate in community centered support groups.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the diagnosis. Usuallyvictims of physical and sexual abuse require therapy todeal with emotional distress associated with the incident.Perpetrators require further psychological evaluation andtreatment. Victims of abuse may have a variety of emo-tional problems including depression, acts of suicide, oranxiety. Children of sexual abuse may as adults enterabusive relationships or have problems with intimacy.The substance abuser may experience relapses, since thecardinal feature of all addictive disorders is a tendency toreturn to symptoms. Elderly patients may suffer fromfurther medical problems and/or anxiety, and in somecases neglect may precipitate death.
Prevention
Prevention programs are geared to education andawareness. Detection of initial symptoms or characteris-tic behaviors may assist in some situations. In somecases treatment may be sought before incident. The pro-fessional treating the abused persons must develop aclear sense of the relationship dynamics and the chancesfor continued harm.ResourcesBOOKS

Acetaminophen
Definition
Acetaminophen is a medicine used to relieve pain and reduce fever.
Purpose
Acetaminophen is used to relieve many kinds ofminor aches and pains—headaches, muscle aches, back-aches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, and theaches and pains that often accompany colds.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 18AcetaminophenGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 18Description
This drug is available without a prescription. Aceta-minophen—or APAP—is sold under various brandnames, including Tylenol, Panadol,AspirinFree Anacin,and Bayer Select Maximum Strength HeadachePain Relief Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, andsinus medicines also contain acetaminophen. Check theingredients listed on the container to see if aceta-minophen is included in the product.Studies have shown that acetaminophen relieves painand reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differencesbetween these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophenis less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However,unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red-ness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults and children age 12 andover is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No morethan 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.Because the drug can potentially harm the liver, peoplewho drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-erably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid thedrug completely.For children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physicianfor dosages for children under age 6 years.
Precautions
Never take more than the recommended dosage ofacetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician ordentist.Patients should not use acetaminophen for more than10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for morethan 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by aphysician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they getworse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three ormore alcoholic beverages a day should check with aphysician before using this drug and should never takemore than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam-age exists from combining large amounts of alcohol andacetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liverdisease or liver infections should also consult with aphysician before using the drug. So should women whoare pregnant or breastfeeding.Smokingcigarettes may interfere with the effective-ness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higherdoses of the medicine, but should not take more than therecommended daily dosage unless told by a physician todo so.KEY TERMS
Arthritis—Inflammation of the joints. The condi-tion causes pain and swelling.Fatigue—Physical or mental weariness.Inflammation—A response to irritation, infection,or injury, resulting in pain, redness, and swelling.Many drugs can interact with one another. Consulta physician or pharmacist before combining aceta-minophen with any other medicine. Do not use twodifferent acetaminophen-containing products at thesame time.Acetaminophen interferes with the results of somemedical tests. Before having medical tests done, check tosee whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results.Avoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may benecessary.
Side effects
Acetaminophen causes few side effects. The mostcommon one is lightheadedness. Some people mayexperience trembling and pain in the side or the lowerback. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, butthey are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such asa rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after takingacetaminophen should stop taking the drug and getimmediate medical attention. Other rare side effectsinclude yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-ing, weakness,fatigue, bloody or black stools, bloodyor cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amountof urine.Overdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,vomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large overdosescan cause liver damage. In case of an overdose, getimmediate medical attention.
Interactions
Acetaminophen may interact with a variety of othermedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater. Among the drugs that may interact withacetaminophen are alcohol,nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs(NSAIDs) such as Motrin,oral contra-ceptives, the antiseizure drug phenytoin (Dilantin), theblood-thinning drug warfarin (Coumadin), the choles-terol-lowering drug cholestyramine (Questran), theantibiotic Isoniazid, and zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT).

Achalasia
Definition
Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that pre-vents normal swallowing.
Description
Achalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that carriesswallowed food from the back of the throat down into thestomach. A ring of muscle called the lower esophagealsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance tothe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contractedto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, thecontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-gus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-tate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such asheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave ofesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushesfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes theesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-ach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” theesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-sis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.
Causes and symptoms
CausesAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nervecells that normally signal the brain to relax theesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-ation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-tion is suspected.SymptomsDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-mon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-ally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,often feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. Theperson has chest painthat is often mistaken for angina pectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belchingare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Othersymptoms may include nighttime coughor recurrentpneumoniacaused by food passing into the lower airways.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medicalhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-toms and on eliminating other medical conditions thatmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnoseachalasia include:• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube ispassed into the esophagus to measure the pressureexerted by the esophageal sphincter.• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed toact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines ofthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier tosee its constriction at the sphincter.• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and alight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy isused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.This test can also detect tumors that cause symptomslike those of achalasia. Cancerof the esophagus occursas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.
Treatment
The first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-tion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-loon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter andinflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effectivein about 70% of patients.Three other treatments are used for achalasia whenballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,botulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it torelax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts thesphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with thedevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdom-inal incisions.• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,reduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-vides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as longas two years.
Prognosis
Most patients with achalasia can be treated effective-ly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unlessesophageal carcinoma develops.

Achondroplasia
Definition
Achondroplasia is the most common cause ofdwarfism, or significantly abnormal short stature.KEY TERMS
Botulinum toxin—Any of a group of potent bacte-rial toxins or poisons produced by different strainsof the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The tox-ins cause muscle paralysis.Dysphagia—Difficulty in swallowing.Endoscopy—A test in which a viewing device anda light source are introduced into the esophagus bymeans of a flexible tube. Endoscopy permits visualinspection of the esophagus for abnormalities.Esophageal manometry—A test in which a thintube is passed into the esophagus to measure thedegree of pressure exerted by the muscles of theesophageal wall.Esophageal sphincter—A circular band of musclethat closes the last few centimeters of the esopha-gus and prevents the backward flow of stomachcontents.Esophagomyotomy—A surgical incision throughthe muscular tissue of the esophagus.Esophagus—The muscular tube that leads from theback of the throat to the entrance of the stomach.Peristalsis—The coordinated, rhythmic wave ofsmooth muscle contraction that forces foodthrough the digestive tract.Reflux—An abnormal backward or return flow ofa fluid.
Description
Achondroplasia is one of a number of chondodystro-phies, in which the development of cartilage, and there-fore, bone is disturbed. The disorder appears in approxi-mately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia isusually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristicappearance of the newborn.Normal bone growth depends on the production ofcartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-um is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-en and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalitiesof this process prevent the bones (especially those inthe limbs) from growing as long as they normallyshould, at the same time allowing the bones to becomeabnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of thebody and the skull are mostly not affected, although theopening from the skull through which the spinal cordpasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-mal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which thespinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomesincreasingly and abnormally small down the length ofthe spine.
Causes and symptoms
Achondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is adominant trait, meaning that anybody with the geneticdefect will display all the symptoms of the disorder. Aparent with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing it

Although achondroplasia can bepassed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of casesoccur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-ingly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one ofonly a few defects known to increase in frequency withincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects arelinked to increased age of the mother).People with achondroplasia have abnormally shortarms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as istheir head. The appearance of short limbs and normalhead size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.The bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-ance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-mal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays anoverly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-opment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Becausethe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormallynarrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord ornerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-num may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between thebrain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulationof too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Childrenwith achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious andrepeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear- ing loss. The disease does not affect either mental capac-ity, or reproductive ability.KEY TERMS
Cartilage—A flexible, fibrous type of connective tis-sue which serves as a base on which bone is built.Foramen magnum—The opening at the base of theskull, through which the spinal cord and the brain-stem pass.Hydrocephalus—An abnormal accumulation offluid within the brain. This accumulation can bedestructive by pressing on brain structures, anddamaging them.Mutation—A new, permanent change in the struc-ture of a gene, which can result in abnormal struc-ture or function somewhere in the body.Spinal canal—The opening that runs through thecenter of the column of spinal bones (vertebrae),and through which the spinal cord passes.Vertebrae—The individual bones of the spinal col-umn which are stacked on top of each other. Thereis a hole in the center of each bone, throughwhich the spinal cord passes.Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often made at birth due to the characteris-tically short limbs, and the appearance of a large head. X-ray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance tothe bones, with the bones of the limbs appearing short inlength, yet broad in width. A number of measurements ofthe bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions.
Treatment
No treatment will reverse the defect present in achon-droplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, withabnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head. Treat-ment of achondroplasia primarily addresses some of thecomplications of the disorder, including problems due tonerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, andabnormal curves in the spine. Children with achondropla-sia who develop middle ear infections (acute otitis media) will require quick treatment with antibioticsand careful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss.
Prognosis
Achondroplasia is a disease which causes consider-able deformity. However, with careful attention paid tothe development of dangerous complications (nervecompression, hydrocephalus), most people are in goodhealth, and can live a normal lifespan.
Prevention
The only form of prevention is through genetic counseling, which could help parents assess their risk ofhaving a child with achondroplasia.Resources

Acid phosphatase test
Definition
Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughoutthe body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like allenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-tions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnosewhether prostate cancerhas spread to other parts of thebody (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness oftreatment. The test has been largely supplanted by theprostate specific antigen test (PSA).
Purpose
The male prostate gland has 100 times more acidphosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostatecancerspreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-phatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads tothe bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who havemetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphataselevels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reducedthrough treatment.Tissues other than prostate have small amounts ofacid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissuescauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.Acid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.Rape investigations will often include testing for thepresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acidphosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer hasmetastasized.
Description
Laboratory testing measures the amount of acidphosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine fromwhat tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it isimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase isfrom the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatasefrom the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acidphosphatase.KEY TERMS
Enzyme—A substance needed to trigger specificchemical reactions.Metastasize—Spread to other parts of the body;usually refers to cancer.Prostate gland—A gland of the male reproductivesystem.Subtle differences between prostatic acid phos-phatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues causethem to react differently in the laboratory when mixedwith certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-cal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-static acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-phatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-ences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-phatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usuallyavailable the next day.
Preparation
This test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.The patient should not have a rectal exam or prostatemassage for two to three days prior to the test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applyingpressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops willreduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site willrelieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and themethod used.
Abnormal results
The highest levels of acid phosphatase are found inmetastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the bone, suchas Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism; diseases ofblood cells, such as sickle cell diseaseor multiple myeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher’s dis-ease, will show moderately increased levels.Certain medications can cause temporary increasesor decreases in acid phosphatase levels. Manipulation ofthe prostate gland through massage, biopsy, or rectalexam before a test can increase the level.

Acne
Definition
Acne is a common skin disease characterized bypimples on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when thepores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skincells, and bacteria.
Description
Acne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, isthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 millionpeople in the United States. While acne can arise at anyage, it usually begins at pubertyand worsens during ado-lescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some timebetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of womendevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.The sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-face. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s naturalmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles withinwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.These follicles open onto the skin through pores. Atpuberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)cause the glands to produce too much sebum. Whenexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, ahard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mildnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-dones, whiteheads and blackheads.Moderate and severe inflammatory types of acneresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni- bacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally lives on theskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakensand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin andwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamedpimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; whendeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type ofacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hardswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laiddown to replace damaged cells.The most common sites of acne are the face, chest,shoulders, and back since these are the parts of the bodywhere the most sebaceous follicles are found.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of acne is unknown. Several riskfactors have been identified:• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,teenagers are more likely to develop acne.• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop itmore often than girls.• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne ingirls.• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne havegreater susceptibility to the disease.• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-tion, during pregnancy, and menopause.• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may causeflare-ups.• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs includingtranquilizers, antidepressants,antibiotics,oral contra-ceptives, and anabolic steroids.• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, orpicking at pimples will make them worse.• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsenacne.• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,and sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.•Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.Acne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamedlesions may cause pain, tenderness,itching, or swelling.The most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-tive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Somepeople, especially teenagers, become emotionally upsetabout their condition, and have problems forming rela-tionships or keeping jobs.
Diagnosis
Acne patients are often treated by family doctors.Complicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 24AcneGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 24disease specialist, or an endocrinologist, a specialist whotreats diseases of the body’s endocrine (hormones andglands) system.Acne has a characteristic appearance and is not diffi-cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medicalhistory, including questions about skin care, diet, factorscausing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment.Physical examinationincludes the face, upper neck,chest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Undergood lighting, the doctor determines what types and howmany blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,whether they are deep or superficial, and whether there isscarring or skin discoloration.In teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,nose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appeartowards the outer part of the face. Adult women mayhave acne on their chins and around their mouths. Theelderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on theupper cheeks and skin around the eyes.Laboratory tests are not done unless the patientappears to have a hormonal disorder or other medicalproblem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests maybe ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-nosing and treating acne.
Treatment
Acne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-tion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria withtopical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choicedepends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, orsevere.Drugs
TOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma-tory acne consists of reducing the formation of newcomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-palene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effectivebecause it increases turnover (deathand replacement) ofskin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topicalantibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.Improvement is usually seen in two to four weeks.Topical medications are available as cream, gel,lotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. Theyinclude antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-thromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugsand open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-nol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics andantibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-mycin), are also used. These drugs may be used formonths to years to achieve disease control.After washing with mild soap, the drugs are appliedalone or in combination, once or twice a day over theentire affected area of skin. Possible side effects includemild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increasedsensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.
ORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily fortwo to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-damycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole(Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include allergicreactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections, dizzi- ness, and tooth discoloration.The goal of treating moderate acne is to decreaseinflammation and prevent new comedone formation. Oneeffective treatment is topical tretinoin along with a topical

Improve-ment is normally seen within four to six weeks, but treat-ment is maintained for at least two to four months.A drug reserved for the treatment of severe acne, oralisotretinoin (Accutane), reduces sebum production andcell stickiness. It is the treatment of choice for severe acnewith cysts and nodules, and is used with or without topicalor oral antibiotics. Taken for four to five months, it pro-vides long-term disease control in up to 60% of patients. Ifthe acne reappears, another course of isotretinoin may beneeded by about 20% of patients, while another 20% maydo well with topical drugs or oral antibiotics. Side effectsinclude temporary worsening of the acne, dry skin, nose-bleeds, vision disorders, and elevated liver enzymes, bloodfats and cholesterol.

It is treated with oral isotretinoin andcorticosteroids.Other treatmentsSeveral surgical or medical treatments are availableto alleviate acne or the resulting scars:• Comedone extraction. The comedo is removed from thepore with a special tool.• Chemical peels. Glycolic acid is applied to peel off thetop layer of skin to reduce scarring.• Dermabrasion. The affected skin is frozen with a chem-ical spray, and removed by brushing or planing.• Punch grafting. Deep scars are excised and the arearepaired with small skin grafts.• Intralesional injection. Corticosteroids are injecteddirectly into inflamed pimples.• Collagen injection. Shallow scars are elevated by colla-gen (protein) injections.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for acne focus on propercleansing to keep the skin oil-free; eating a well-bal-anced diet high in fiber, zinc, and raw foods; and avoid-ing alcohol, dairy products,smoking,caffeine, sugar,processed foods, and foods high in iodine, such assalt. Supplementation with herbs such as burdock root(Arctium lappa), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and with nutrients suchas essential fatty acids, vitamin B complex, zinc, vitaminA, and chromium is also recommended. Chinese herbalremedies used for acne include cnidium seed ( Cnidium monnieri) and honeysuckle flower (Lonicera japonica). Wholistic physicians or nutritionists can recommend theproper amounts of these herbs.
Prognosis
Acne is not curable, although long-term control isachieved in up to 60% of patients treated with
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 26AcneGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 26isotretinoin. It can be controlled by proper treatment,with improvement taking two or more months. Acnetends to reappear when treatment stops, but spontaneous-ly improves over time. Inflammatory acne may leavescars that require further treatment.
Prevention
There are no sure ways to prevent acne, but the fol-lowing steps may be taken to minimize flare-ups:• gentle washing of affected areas once or twice every day• avoid abrasive cleansers• use noncomedogenic makeup and moisturizers• shampoo often and wear hair off face• eat a well-balanced diet, avoiding foods that triggerflare-ups• unless told otherwise, give dry pimples a limitedamount of sun exposur• do not pick or squeeze blemishes• reduce stressResources

Acoustic neuroma
Definition
An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor involvingcells of the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibulo-cochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve).
Description
The vestibulocochlear nerve extends from the innerear to the brain and is made up of a vestibular branch,often called the vestibular nerve, and a cochlear branch,called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular and cochlearnerves lie next to one another. They also run along sideother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type ofvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the leftear and one that extends from the right ear.The vestibular nerve transmits information concern-ing balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlearnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibularnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called amyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumoris an abnormal growth of tissue that results from theuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are oftencalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumorsthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds thevestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are consideredbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread toother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere alongthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where thevestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canalthat connects the brain and the inner ear.An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-lar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumoris a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumorarises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acousticneuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilat-eral acoustic neuromas occur as part of a hereditary con-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 27Acoustic neuromaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 27dition called NeurofibromatosisType 2 (NF2). A personwith NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developingacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and cantake years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remainso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As theacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo andbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows largeenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing lossand a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu-ally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the regionand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-ening if it becomes large enough to press against andinterfere with the functioning of the brain.
Causes and symptoms
CausesAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change orabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in anerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes inevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. OneNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother andone NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of thefather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.Only one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene isnecessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing inone of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nervethen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genesbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someonewith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developedspontaneously is not at increased risk for having childrenwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is alsopossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may becaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-venting the formation of tumors.Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone isaffected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person withNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and onechanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother orfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously whenthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell ofthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-ma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheathcells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 oftendevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The meanage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years ofage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acousticneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk fordeveloping cataractsand tumors in other nerve cells.Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma arenot affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlearnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve anumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma andother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably isaffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataractsand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On theother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateralacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family historyof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.SymptomsSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere withthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The mostcommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearingloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes reportdifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceivingthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when theirhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases thehearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually overtime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-mately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.Acoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning ofthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve andvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent ofsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, whichis characterized by dizzinessor a whirling sensation.Larger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigobut more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-al feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of peoplewith an acoustic neuroma.As the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-ing cranial nerves. Compression of the fifth cranial nervecan result in facial painand or numbness. Compression ofthe seventh cranial nerve can cause spasms, weakness or

Double vision is a raresymptom but can result when the 6th cranial nerve is affect-ed. Swallowing and/or speaking difficulties can occur if thetumor presses against the 9th, 10th, or 12th cranial nerves.If left untreated, the tumor can become large enoughto press against and affect the functioning of the brainstem. The brain stem is the stalk like portion of the brainthat joins the spinal cord to the cerebrum, the thinking andreasoning part of the brain. Different parts of the brain-stem have different functions such as the control of breath-ing and muscle coordination. Large tumors that impact thebrain stem can result in headaches, walking difficulties(gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of themuscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic neuro-ma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can cause nau-sea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually coma, respiratorydifficulties and death. In the vast majority of cases, how-ever, the tumor is discovered and treated long before it islarge enough to cause such serious manifestations.

An acoustic neuroma is suspected insomeone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss that isless severe in one ear than the other ear(asymmetrical).Sometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR,BAER) test is performed to help establish whethersomeone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma. Duringthe ABR examination, a harmless electrical impulse ispassed from the inner ear to the brainstem. An acousticneuroma can interfere with the passage of this electri-cal impulse and this interference can, sometimes beidentified through the ABR evaluation. A normal ABRexamination does not rule out the possibility of anacoustic neuroma. An abnormal ABR examinationincreases the likelihood that an acoustic neuroma ispresent but other tests are necessary to confirm thepresence of a tumor.If an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected thenmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is usually per-formed. The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that is

Com-puterized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is unable toidentify smaller tumors; but it can be used when anacoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI evaluationcannot be performed.Once an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evalua-tion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genet-ic counselor may be recommended. The purpose of thisevaluation is to obtain a detailed family history andcheck for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspectedthen DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testinginvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-tine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-ed with NF2.
Treatment
The three treatment options for acoustic neuromaare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physicianand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-ent options prior to making a decision about treatment.The patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumorsize, and tumor location should be considered.MicrosurgeryThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is themost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In mostcases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. Ifthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yetthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then onlypart of the tumor may be removed. During the procedurethe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance andgeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranialnerves is done during the procedure so that damage tothese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearingis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also takeplace during the surgery.Most people stay in the hospital four to seven daysfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes fourto six weeks. Most people experience fatigueand head discomfort following the surgery. Problems with balanceand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at mostmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In mostcases these complications can be managed successfullyand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgerybrings with it a risk of stroke, damage to the brain stem,infection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-nial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result fromthe surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one tofive years following the surgery because of possibleregrowth of the tumor.Stereotactic Radiation therapyDuring stereotactic radiation therapy, also calledradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-tion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-ation is administered in a single large dose, under localanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. Thisresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but littleradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or atleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of thepatient is therefore recommended.Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which cansometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy canalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, whichcan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysisof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms aretemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This typeof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.ObservationAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and insome cases they will stop growing and even becomesmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.Long-term observation may be appropriate for examplein an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma andfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acousticneuroma that was detected through an evaluation foranother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the onlyhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-ger of an observational approach is that as the tumorgrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.
Prognosis
The prognosis for someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Longterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-mon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth ofthe tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiationtherapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno-sis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increasedrisk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors.

Acrocyanosis
Definition
Acrocyanosis is a decrease in the amount of oxygendelivered to the extremities. The hands and feet turn bluebecause of the lack of oxygen. Decreased blood supplyto the affected areas is caused by constriction or spasm ofsmall blood vessels.
Description
Acrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constric-tion or narrowing of small blood vessels in the skin of affect-ed patients. The spasm of the blood vessels decreases theamount of blood that passes through them, resulting in lessblood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands maybe the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue andbecome cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms,while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seenmainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainlycosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable,with sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet.
Causes and symptoms
The sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasmsin the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to theextremities. The spasms are a contraction of the musclesin the walls of the blood vessels. The contractiondecreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels,thereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through theaffected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis,resulting in long term reduction of blood supply to thehands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through theblood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas doesnot starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels nearthe surface of the skin are affected.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by observation of the main clini-cal symptoms, including persistently blue and sweatyhands and/or feet and a lack of pain. Cooling the handsincreases the blueness, while warming the hands decreas-

Raynaud’s dis-easediffers from acrocyanosis in that it causes white andred skin coloration phases, not just bluish discoloration.
Treatment
Acrocyanosis usually isn’t treated. Drugs that blockthe uptake of calcium (calcium channel blockers) and alpha-one antagonists reduce the symptoms in mostcases. Drugs that dilate blood vessels are only effectivesome of the time. Sweating from the affected areas canbe profuse and require treatment. Surgery to cut the sym-pathetic nerves is performed rarely.
Prognosis
Acrocyanosis is a benign and persistent disease. Themain concern of patients is cosmetic. Left untreated, thedisease does not worsen.Resources

Acromegaly and gigantism
Definition
Acromegaly is a disorder in which the abnormalrelease of a particular chemical from the pituitary glandin the brain causes increased growth in bone and soft tis-sue, as well as a variety of other disturbances throughoutthe body. This chemical released from the pituitary glandis called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability toKEY TERMS
Sympathetic nerve—A nerve of the autonomicnervous system that regulates involuntary andautomatic reactions, especially to stress.process and use nutrients like fats and sugars is alsoaltered. In children whose bony growth plates have notclosed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result inexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is calledgigantism, with the additional bone growth causingunusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bonegrowth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.
Description
Acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring inapproximately 50 out of every one million people (50/1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Becausethe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are notidentified until they are middle aged.
Causes and symptoms
The pituitary is a small gland located at the base ofthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releasescertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important tothe functioning of other organs or body systems. Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities, including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions. Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-duction of GH.Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives inputfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, locatedat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. Forexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitaryto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should alsodirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.In acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GHand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growththroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stopproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormalpeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the bodybegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability toprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.In acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet beginto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,and forehead also grow, and facial features are describedas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and becausethe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.Due to swelling within the structures of the throat andsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-low, and patients may develop loud snoring. Various hor-monal changes cause symptoms such as:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 32Acromegaly and gigantismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32• heavy sweating• oily skin• increased coarse body hair• improper processing of sugars in the diet (and some-times actual diabetes)• high blood pressure• increased calcium in the urine (sometimes leading tokidney stones)• increased risk of gallstones; and• swelling of the thyroid glandPeople with acromegaly have more skin tags, or out-growths of tissue, than normal. This increase in skin tagsis also associated with the development of growths,called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-ally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly oftensuffer from headaches and arthritis. The variousswellings and enlargements throughout the body maypress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling orburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.The most common cause of this disorder (in 90% ofpatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumorsare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As thesetumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within thebrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interferingwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. Inrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production ofGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.
Diagnosis
Because acromegaly produces slow changes overtime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, thecharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is oftennot recognized by family members, friends, or long-timefamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by anew physician who sees the patient for the first time andis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.Comparing old photographs from a number of differenttime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.Because the quantity of GH produced varies widelyunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels ofGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis ofacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring anincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) areuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-preted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 varywhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder- ly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show adecrease in GH production when given a large dose ofsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not showthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-duction. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is usefulfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locatingan adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the searchfor a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.
Treatment
The first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal ofall or part of the pituitary adenoma. Removal requiressurgery, usually performed by entering the skull throughthe nose. While this surgery can cause rapid improvementof many acromegaly symptoms, most patients will also

Bromocrip-tine (Parlodel) is a medication that can be taken by mouth,while octreotide (Sandostatin) must be injected every eighthours. Both of these medications are helpful in reducingGH production, but must often be taken for life and pro-duce their own unique side effects. Some patients who can-not undergo surgery are treated with radiation therapyto the pituitary in an attempt to shrink the adenoma. Radiatingthe pituitary may take up to 10 years, however, and mayalso injure/destroy other normal parts of the pituitary.
Prognosis
Without treatment, patients with acromegaly willmost likely die early because of the disease’s effects on theheart, lungs, brain, or due to the development of cancerin the large intestine. With treatment, however, a patient withacromegaly may be able to live a normal lifespan.Resources

Actinomycosis
Definition
Actinomycosis is an infection primarily caused bythe bacterium Actinomyces israelii. Infection most oftenoccurs in the face and neck region and is characterizedby the presence of a slowly enlarging, hard, red lump.

A comparison of the right hand of a person afflicted withacromegaly (left) and the hand of a normal sized person.(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 34Description
Actinomycosis is a relatively rare infection occurringin one out of 300,000(1/300,000) people per year. It ischaracterized by the presence of a lump or mass that oftenforms, draining sinus tracts to the skin surface. Fifty per-cent of actinomycosis cases are of the head and neck region(also called “lumpy jaw” and “cervicofacial actinomyco-sis”), 15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, andthe rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are threetimes more likely to develop actinomycosis than women.
Causes and symptoms
Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacteriumActinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally presentin the mouth but can cause disease if it enters tissues fol-lowing an injury. Actinomyces israeliiis an anaerobicbacterium which means it dislikes oxygen but grows verywell in deep tissues where oxygen levels are low. Tooth extraction, tooth disease,root canal treatment,j a w surgery, or poor dental hygiene can allow Actinomycesisraeliito cause an infection in the head and neck region.The main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis isthe presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The lumpmay or may not be red. Feveroccurs in some cases.
Diagnosis
Cervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by a fam-ily doctor or dentist and the patient may be referred to an oralsurgeon or infectious disease specialist. The diagnosis ofactinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of ared lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is stronglysuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history oftooth extraction or signs of tooth decayor poor dentalhygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of thefluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “sul-fur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro-duced by Actinomyces israelii. A biopsy may be performed toremove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure can beperformed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office. Occa-sionally the bacteria can be cultured from the sinus tract fluidor from samples of the infected tissue.Actinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, orbrain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptomsoften mimic those of other diseases. Actinomycosis ofthe lungs or abdomen can resemble tuberculosisor can- cer. x-ray results, the presence of draining sinus tracts,and microscopic analysis and culturing of infected tissueassist in the diagnosis.
Treatment
Actinomycosis is difficult to treat because of itsdense tissue location. Surgery is often required to drainKEY TERMS
Biopsy—The process which removes a sample oftissue for microscopic examination to aid in thediagnosis of a disease.Sinus tract—A narrow, elongated channel in thebody which allows the escape of fluid.the lesion and/or to remove the site of infection. To killthe bacteria, large doses of penicillin are given through avein daily for two to six weeks followed by six to twelvemonths of penicillin taken by mouth. Tetracycline, clin-damycin, or erythromycin may be used instead of peni-cillin. The antibiotic therapy must be completed to insurethat the infection does not return. Hyperbaric oxygen(oxygen under high pressure) therapy in combinationwith the antibiotic therapy has been successful.
Prognosis
Complete recovery is achieved following treatment.If left untreated, the infection may cause localized bonedestruction.
Prevention
The best prevention is to maintain good dental hy-giene.Resources

Acupressure massage performed by a therapist can bevery effective both as prevention and as a treatment for manyhealth conditions, including headaches, general aches andpains, colds and flu, arthritis,allergies,asthma, nervous ten-sion, menstrual cramps, sinus problems, sprains, tennis elbow, and toothaches, among others. Unlike acupuncturewhich requires a visit to a professional, acupressure can beperformed by a layperson. Acupressure techniques are fairlyeasy to learn, and have been used to provide quick, cost-free,and effective relief from many symptoms. Acupressurepoints can also be stimulated to increase energy and feelingsof well-being, reduce stress, stimulate the immune system,and alleviate sexual dysfunction.
Description
OriginsOne of the oldest text of Chinese medicine is theHuang Di, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of InternalMedicine, which may be at least 2,000 years old. Chi-nese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure,herbal remedies, diet,exercise, lifestyle changes, andother remedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly allof the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in theWest today, including acupuncture, acupressure, shiatsu, and Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinesemedicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-pressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied thepuncture woundsof Chinese warriors, noting that certainpoints on the body created interesting results when stim-ulated. The oldest known text specifically on acupunc-ture points, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form ofacupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined thatstimulating points on the body with massage and pres-sure could be effective for treating certain problems.Outside of Asian-American communities, Chinesemedicine remained virtually unknown in the UnitedStates until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became thefirst U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s trip, jour-nalists were amazed to observe major operations beingperformed on patients without the use of anesthetics.Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on,

At that time, a famous columnist for the New York Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery andelected to use acupuncture for anesthesia. Later, he wrotesome convincing stories on its effectiveness. Despitebeing neglected by mainstream medicine and the Ameri-can Medical Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chi-nese medicine became a central to alternative medicinepractitioners in the United States. Today, there are mil-lions of patients who attest to its effectiveness, and near-ly 9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.Acupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinesemedicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as bymassage therapists. Most massage schools in Americaninclude acupressure techniques as part of their bodyworkprograms. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu-pressure, working with the same points on the body andthe same general principles, although it was developedover centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexologyis a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.Jin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasingnumber of practitioners in America that combines acu-pressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichiantheory, and meditation.Acupressure and Chinese medicineChinese medicine views the body as a small part ofthe universe, subject to laws and principles of harmonyand balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp adestinction as Western medicine does between mind andbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions andmental states are every bit as influential on disease aspurely physical mechanisms, and considers factors likework, environment, and relationships as fundamental to apatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very differentsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. WhileWestern medicine typically describes health as mainlyphysical processes composed of chemical equations andreactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi,and the organ system to describe health and the body.Everything in the universe has properties of yin andyang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-ward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.Nothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-ciples always interact and affect each other, although thebody and its organs can become imbalanced by havingeither too much or too little of either.Chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qior kiin Japan- ese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy. It is found infood, air, water, and sunlight, and it travels through thebody in channels called meridians. There are 12 major

Chinese medicine has developed intri-cate systems of how organs are related to physical andmental symptoms, and it has devised correspondingtreatments using the meridian and pressure point net-works that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu-pressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblockthe circulation of chi, by activating very specific points,called pressure points or acupoints. Acupressure seeksto stimulate the points on the chi meridians that passclose to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock andmanipulate with finger pressure.Acupressure can be used as part of a Chinesephysician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther-apy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill-nesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines apatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental andemotional activity, taking the pulse usually at thewrists, examining the tongue and complexion, andobserving the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get acomplete diagnosis of which organs and meridianpoints are out of balance. When the imbalance is locat-ed, the physician will recommend specific pressurepoints for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure isrecommended, the patient might opt for a series oftreatments from a massage therapist.In massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate apatient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massagetherapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as aChinese physician’s.

Sometimes, special herbs (Artemesia vulgarisor moxa) may be placed on a point to warm it, a processcalled moxibustion. A session of acupressure is general-ly a very pleasant experience, and some people experi-ence great benefit immediately. For more chronic con-ditions, several sessions may be necessary to relieveand improve conditions.Acupressure massage usually costs from $30–70 perhour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician oracupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to avisit to an allopathic physician if the practitioner is anMD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and con-sumers should be aware if their policies cover alternativetreatment, acupuncture, or massage therapy.Self-treatmentAcupressure is easy to learn, and there are manygood books that illustrate the position of acupoints andmeridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as it canbe done anywhere, and it’s a good form of treatment forspouses and partners to give to each other and for parentsto perform on children for minor conditions.While giving self-treatment or performing acupressureon another, a mental attitude of calmness and attention isimportant, as one person’s energy can be used to helpanother’s. Loose, thin clothing is recommended. There arethree general techniques for stimulating a pressure point.• Tonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is doneby pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with afirm, steady pressure, holding it for up to two minutes.• Dispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked chi,and the finger or thumb is moved in a circular motion orslightly in and out of the point for two minutes.• Calming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm tocover the point and gently stroke the area for about twominutes.There are many pressure points that are easily foundand memorized to treat common ailments from headachesto colds.• For headaches, toothaches, sinus problems, and pain inthe upper body, the “LI4” point is recommended. It islocated in the web between the thumb and index finger,on the back of the hand. Using the thumb and index fin-ger of the other hand, apply a pinching pressure until
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 38AcupressureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 38the point is felt, and hold it for two minutes. Pregnantwomen should never press this point.• To calm the nerves and stimulate digestion, find the“CV12” point that is four thumb widths above the navelin the center of the abdomen. Calm the point with thepalm, using gentle stroking for several minutes.• To stimulate the immune system, find the “TH5” pointon the back of the forearm two thumb widths above thewrist. Use a dispersing technique, or circular pressurewith the thumb or finger, for two minutes on each arm.• For headaches, sinus congestion, and tension, locate the“GB20” points at the base of the skull in the back of thehead, just behind the bones in back of the ears. Dispersethese points for two minutes with the fingers or thumbs.Also find the “yintang” point, which is in the middle ofthe forehead between the eyebrows. Disperse it withgentle pressure for two minutes to clear the mind and torelieve headaches.
Precautions
Acupressure is a safe technique, but it is not meant toreplace professional health care. A physician shouldalways be consulted when there are doubts about medicalconditions. If a condition is chronic, a professional shouldbe consulted; purely symptomatic treatment can exacer-bate chronic conditions. Acupressure should not beapplied to open wounds, or where there is swelling andinflammation. Areas of scar tissue, blisters,boils,rashes, or varicose veinsshould be avoided. Finally, certain acu-pressure points should not be stimulated on people withhigh or low blood pressure and on pregnant women.
Research and general acceptance
In general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gainacceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideasvery foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West-ern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-ble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-tain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-times too simple for scientists to believe.Western scientists, in trying to account for the actionof acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part ofthe neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-pedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominatedfor the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject calledCross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-ils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measur-ing devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that thebody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, andthat traditional acupressure meridians and points containedamounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressureremain difficult to document in terms of the biochemicalprocesses involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-ry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressureand acupuncture. However, a body of research is growingthat verifies the effectiveness in acupressure andacupuncture techniques in treating many problems and incontrolling pain.ResourcesBOOKS

Acupuncture
Definition
Acupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment intraditional Chinese medicine. It involves the use ofsharp, thin needles that are inserted in the body at veryspecific points. This process is believed to adjust and alterthe body’s energy flow into healthier patterns, and is usedto treat a wide variety of illnesses and health conditions.
Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendsacupuncture as an effective treatment for over forty med-ical problems, including allergies, respiratory conditions,gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological problems, ner-vous conditions, and disorders of the eyes, nose andthroat, and childhood illnesses, among others. Acupunc-ture has been used in the treatment of alcoholismand substance abuse. It is an effective and low-cost treatment
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 39AcupunctureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 39for headaches and chronic pain, associated with problemslike back injuries and arthritis. It has also been used tosupplement invasive Western treatments like chemother-apyand surgery. Acupuncture is generally most effectivewhen used as prevention or before a health conditionbecomes acute, but it has been used to help patients suf-fering from cancerand AIDS. Acupuncture is limited intreating conditions or traumas that require surgery oremergency care (such as for broken bones).
Description
OriginsThe original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei Ching, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-cine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old.Thousands of books since then have been written on thesubject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophiesspread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all ofthe forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the Westtoday, including acupuncture,shiatsu,acupressuremas- sage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots inChinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture devel-oped when early Chinese physicians observed unpredict-ed effects of puncture woundsin Chinese warriors. Theoldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classicof Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D. Although acupunc-ture is its best known technique, Chinese medicine tradi-tionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestylechanges and other means to treat patients.In the early 1900s, only a few Western physicianswho had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,but outside of Asian-American communities it remainedvirtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixonbecame the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’strip, journalists were amazed to observe major operationsbeing performed on patients without the use of anesthetics.Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on withonly acupuncture needles inserted into them to controlpain. During that time, a famous columnist for the New York Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery andelected to use acupuncture instead of pain medication, andhe wrote some convincing stories on its effectiveness.Today acupuncture is being practiced in all 50 statesby over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000 MDs includ-ing it in their practices. Acupuncture has shown notablesuccess in treating many conditions, and over 15 millionAmericans have used it as a therapy. Acupuncture, how-

The American Medical Association has beenresistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts verydifferent from the Western scientific model.Several forms of acupuncture are being used today inAmerica. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-dles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-tice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points onlyon the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balanceinternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncturebased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditionalChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.Basic ideas of Chinese medicineChinese medicine views the body as a small part ofthe universe, and subject to universal laws and principlesof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does notdraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, betweenmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships asfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols andideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-icine typically describes health in terms of measurablephysical processes made up of chemical reactions, theChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-tem, and the five elements to describe health and thebody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it isworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.
YIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,the universe and the body can be described by two sepa-rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yinis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark andyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downwardand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is evercompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.These two principles are always interacting, opposing,and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allowthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniouslytogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms

(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 41of high blood pressure, the Chinese system would saythat the heart organ might have too much yang, andwould recommend methods either to reduce the yang orto increase the yin of the heart, depending on the othersymptoms and organs in the body. Thus, acupuncturetherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, orincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.
CHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-icine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi is the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, foodand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital forcethat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi fromthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level andquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state ofphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travelsthrough the body along channels called meridians.
THE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, thereare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triplewarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Eachorgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organinteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. Asthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chiwhich can move through the body, and these movethrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinesedoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptomsare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or moreorgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from oneKEY TERMS

Each organ has a different profile ofsymptoms it can manifest.THE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-ry is that the world and body are made up of five mainelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-ments are all interconnected, and each element eithergenerates or controls another element. For instance,water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinesesystem uses elements and organs to describe and treatconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated withwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the twoorgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fireproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made byacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/orincrease energy in the kidney system.The Chinese have developed an intricate system ofhow organs and elements are related to physical andmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Westernscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.For instance, Western medicine has observed that withsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but itstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,this connection between the two organs has long beenestablished.
MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi- nese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy ortreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innateharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors likeemotions, external factors like the environment andweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, andgerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily aproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in theenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms andbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flowof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-en the body and prompt it to heal itself.
A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing anacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’smedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient tofind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, thepulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. Fromthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns ofsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 42AcupunctureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-ist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or moreof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used inacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During anindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,depending on which meridian points are chosen.Acupuncture needles are always sterilized andacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels arebeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficiallayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require adepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinchingsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slightelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustionmay be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa ormugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncturepoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-times use cupping, during which small suction cups areplaced on meridian points to stimulate them.How long the needles are inserted also varies. Somepatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clearproblems and provide tonification(strengthening ofhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit toan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The numberof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with someconditions improved in one or two sessions and othersrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course ofweeks or months.Costs for acupuncture can vary, depending on whetherthe practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MDacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement alsovaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-lations have been changing often. Some states authorizeMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, andsome states have mandated that general coverage pay foracupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisionsfor acupuncture in their individual policies.
Precautions
Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If apatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more thanone physician should be consulted. Also, a patient shouldalways feel comfortable and confident that theiracupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.Research and general acceptance
Mainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-ture; although more MDs are using it, the American MedicalAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty. The reasonfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult toscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisibleenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting thatacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that theenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system andthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, ornatural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-guity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues toshow effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain toalleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and researchin acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-tive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currentlyfunding research in the use of acupuncture for treatingdepression and attention-deficit disorder.Resources

Acute kidney failure
Definition
Acute kidney failure occurs when illness, infection,or injury damages the kidneys. Temporarily, the kidneys
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 43Acute kidney failureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 43cannot adequately remove fluids and wastes from thebody or maintain the proper level of certain kidney-regu-lated chemicals in the bloodstream.
Description
The kidneys are the body’s natural filtration system.They perform the critical task of processing approximate-ly 200 quarts of fluid in the bloodstream every 24 hours.Waste products like urea and toxins, along with excessfluids, are removed from the bloodstream in the form ofurine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-tioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin toaccumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in thebloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure maybecome puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,and feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, andthey may experience fatigueand nausea.Unlike chronic kidney failure, which is long termand irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-dition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typicallybe reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to thekidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently asa complication of serious illness, like heart failure,l i v e r failure,dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleed-ing (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-tion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-ease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.
Causes and symptoms
Acute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-ent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditionsfall into three main categories:prerenal,postrenal, and intrarenalconditions.Prerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, butcan cause diminished kidney function. They are the mostcommon cause of acute renal failure, and include:• dehydration• hemorrhage• septicemia, or sepsis• heart failure• liver failure• burnsPostrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-ing the urinary tract. These conditions include:• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatichypertrophy)• bladder or pelvic tumors•kidney stones(calculi)Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease ordirect injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidneyproblems• drug abuse or overdose• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certainpainmedicines• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of thekidney (glomerulonephritis)• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)Common symptoms of acute kidney failure include:• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-thropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red bloodcell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking ofthe kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-ing to anemia.• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva maycause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitaminD, which helps the body absorb calcium and keepsbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bonesmay become brittle. In children, normal growth may bestunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of highphosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acidmay cause gout.• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,and around the eyes.• frequent urination.• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause itto foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,or ureters.• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention offluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. Thismakes blood pressure rise.• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and thepresence of anemia may cause the patient to feelexhausted.• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,accumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.An increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.• lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidneyproblems (like kidney stones and other obstructions)may have pain where the kidneys are located, in thesmall of the back below the ribs.• nausea. Urea in the gastric juices may cause upsetstomach.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 44Acute kidney failureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 44Diagnosis
Kidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A nephrolo-gist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-sulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-ment options. The patient that is suspected of havingacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests todetermine the level of kidney function. A blood test willassess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urinesamples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hourperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.Determining the cause of kidney failure is critical toproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-sary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and ifthe kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays,magnetic res-onance imaging(MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),ultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneysmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasoundof the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.
Treatment
Treatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatmentis directed to the underlying, primary medical conditionthat has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions maybe treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,diuretics, blood transfusion, or medications. Postrenalconditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgeryand/or medication.Frequently, patients in acute kidney failure requirehemodialysis,hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysisto fil- ter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-mary medical condition can be controlled.
Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis involves circulating the patient’sblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-cuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up ofplastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-ficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors andmaintains blood flow and administers dialysate.Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used todraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s bloodleaves the body through the vein and travels through theECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.During dialysis, waste products in the bloodstreamare carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytesand other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,chemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.KEY TERMS
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product thatis formed in the liver and collects in the blood-stream; patients with kidney failure have highBUN levels.Creatinine—A protein produced by muscle thathealthy kidneys filter out.Extracorporeal—Outside of, or unrelated to, thebody.Ischemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ ortissue.Nephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.Radiocontrast agents—Dyes administered to apatient for the purposes of a radiologic study.Sepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.Vasopressors—Medications that constrict the bloodvessels.A dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,depending on the type of dialyzer used and the physicalcondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times aweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases.
Hemofiltration
Hemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-ment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-tion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-cally ill patients. These patients are typically very sickand may have heart problems or circulatory problems.They cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-ysis. They also frequently need antibiotics,nutrition, vasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein totreat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration iscontinuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients inkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.Like hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. Ahollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer toremove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, ablood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. Thevolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-tration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration ratesare slower and gentler on the circulatory system.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 45Acute kidney failureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 45Hemofiltration treatment will generally be used until kid-ney failure is reversed.
Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidneyfailure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis. Inperitoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’sabdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexibletube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted intothe patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter isused to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Wasteproducts and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood-stream into the dialysate solution. After a certain timeperiod, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from theabdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There arethree type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according totreatment time and administration method.Peritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment optionfor infants and children. Their small size can make veinaccess difficult to maintain. It is not recommended forpatients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominaldefects (like a hernia) that might reduce the efficiency ofthe treatment. It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of thesmall pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).
Prognosis
Because many of the illnesses and underlying con-ditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,the prognosis for these patients many times is not good.Studies have estimated overall deathrates for acute kid-ney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, diebecause of the primary disease that has caused the kid-ney failure. These figures may also be misleadingbecause patients who experience kidney failure as aresult of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones ordehydration) have an excellent chance of completerecovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriatetreatment are key to patient recovery.Up to 10% of patients who experience acute kidneyfailure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They willeventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure orend-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-term dialysis or kidney transplantationto replace theirlost renal functioning.
Prevention
Since acute kidney failure can be caused by manythings, prevention is difficult. Medications that mayimpair kidney function should be given cautiously.Patients with pre-existing kidney conditions who arehospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care-fully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat-ments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid-ney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrastagents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution.ResourcesBOOKS

Acute lymphangitis
Definition
Acute lymphangitis is a bacterial infection in thelymphatic vessels which is characterized by painful, redstreaks below the skin surface. This is a potentially seri-ous infection which can rapidly spread to the blood-stream and be fatal.
Description
Acute lymphangitis affects a critical member of theimmune system—the lymphatic system. Waste materialsfrom nearly every organ in the body drain into the lym-phatic vessels and are filtered in small organs calledlymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as bacteria or viruses,are processed in the lymph nodes to generate an immuneresponse to fight an infection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 46Acute lymphangitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 46In acute lymphangitis, bacteria enter the bodythrough a cut, scratch, insect bite, surgical wound, orother skin injury. Once the bacteria enter the lymphaticsystem, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphaticvessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vesselbecomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visiblebelow the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occursso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fastenough to stop the infection.If left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissuedestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,painful lump called an abscessmay be formed in theinfected area. Cellulitis, a generalized infection of thelower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-ria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.Lay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seenin the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-ous illness and may be fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Acute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-terium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially danger-ous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of theheart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has beencalled the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-ria may also cause lymphangitis.Although anyone can develop lymphangitis, somepeople are more at risk. People who have had radical mas- tectomy(removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), aleg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrentlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection onthe foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.The characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitisare the wide, red streaks which travel from the site ofinfection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin mayoccur. The bacterial infection causes a feverof 100-104°F(38°–40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscleaches,headache, chills, and loss of appetite may be felt.
Diagnosis
If lymphangitis is suspected, the person should callhis or her doctor immediately or go to an emergencyroom. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by thefamily doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer-gency room doctor. The painful, red streaks just belowthe skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acutelymphangitis. A sample of blood would be taken for cul-ture to determine whether the bacteria have entered thebloodstream. A biopsy (removal of a piece of infectedtissue) sample may be taken for culture to identify whichKEY TERMS
Biopsy—The process which removes a sample ofdiseased or infected tissue for microscopic exami-nation to aid in diagnosis.Lymphatic system—A component of the immunesystem consisting of vessels and nodes. Wastematerials from organs drain into the lymphaticvessels and are filtered by the lymph nodes.Septicemia—Disease caused by the presence andgrowth of bacteria in the bloodstream.type of bacteria is causing the infection. Diagnosis isimmediate because it is based primarily on the symp-toms. Most insurance policies should cover the expensesfor the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphangitis.
Treatment
Because of the serious nature of this infection, treat-ment would begin immediately even before the bacterialculture results were available. The only treatment foracute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of anantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growingstreptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly andeasily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may beincluded in the treatment to kill any streptococci whichare not growing and are in a resting state. Alternatively, a“broad spectrum” antibiotic may be used which wouldkill many different kinds of bacteria.Aspirinor other medications which reduce the pain and the fever may also be given. Medications whichreduce any inflammation of the infected region may alsobe provided. The patient is likely to be hospitalized toadminister the antibiotic and other medications and toclosely monitor his or her condition. Surgical drainage ofan abscess may be necessary.
Prognosis
Complete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatmentis begun at an early stage of the infection. However, ifuntreated, acute lymphangitis can be a very serious andeven deadly disease. Acute lymphangitis that goes untreat-ed can spread, causing tissue damage. Extensive tissuedamage would need to be repaired by plastic surgery.Spread of the infection into the bloodstream could be fatal.
Prevention
Although acute lymphangitis can occur in anyone, goodhygiene and general health may help to prevent infections.

Acute poststreptococcalglomerulonephritis
Definition
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis(APSGN) is an inflammation of the kidney tubules(glomeruli) that filter waste products from the blood, fol-lowing a streptococcal infection such as strep throat. APSGN is also called postinfectious glomerulonephritis.
Description
APSGN develops after certain streptococcal bacteria(group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) have infected theskin or throat. Antigens from the dead streptococciclump together with the antibodies that killed them.These clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause thetubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil-ity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset ofAPSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average twoweeks) after the streptococcal infection.APSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affectingabout one of every 10,000 people, although four or fivetimes that many may actually be affected by it but showno symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boysbetween the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age.
Causes and symptoms
Frequent sore throats and a history of streptococcalinfection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN. Symp-toms of APSGN include:• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling (edema) initial- ly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs• low urine output (oliguria)• blood in the urine (hematuria)• protein in the urine (proteinuria)• high blood pressure• joint painor stiffnessDiagnosis
Diagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’shistory, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-tain laboratory tests. Urinalysisusually shows blood andprotein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-nine (two waste products normally filtered out of theblood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-cating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensiveblood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirmthat a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. Athroat culturemay also show the presence of group Abeta-hemolytic streptococci.
Treatment
Treatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve thesymptoms and prevent complications. Some patients areadvised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrictfluid and salt intake. Antibioticsmay be prescribed tokill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presenceis confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to helpcontrol high blood pressure and diureticsmay be used toreduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysisis rarely needed.
Prognosis
Most children (up to 95%) fully recover fromAPSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults (upto 70%) also recover fully. In those who do not recoverfully, chronic or progressive problems of kidney functionmay occur. Kidney failure may result in some patients.
Prevention
Receiving prompt treatment for streptococcal infec-tionsmay prevent APSGN.Resources

Acute stress disorder
Definition
Acute stressdisorder (ASD) is an anxietydisorder characterized by a cluster of dissociative and anxietysymptoms occurring within one month of a traumaticevent. (Dissociation is a psychological reaction to traumain which the mind tries to cope by “sealing off” somefeatures of the trauma from conscious awareness).
Description
Acute stress disorder is a new diagnostic categorythat was introduced in 1994 to differentiate time-limitedreactions to trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD).
Causes and symptoms
Acute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau-ma, which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fearand, usually, involves threats to life or serious injury tooneself or others. Examples are rape, mugging, combat,natural disasters, etc.The symptoms of stress disorder include a combiningof one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms withthe avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event. Disso-ciative symptoms include emotional detachment, tempo-rary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.Anxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-der include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-lems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com-bination of the patient’s history and a physical examina-tionto rule out diseases that can cause anxiety. TheKEY TERMS
Depersonalization—A dissociative symptom inwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unre-al, is changing, or is dissolving.Derealization—A dissociative symptom in whichthe external environment is perceived as unreal.Dissociation—A reaction to trauma in which themind splits off certain aspects of the trauma fromconscious awareness. Dissociation can affect thepatient’s memory, sense of reality, and sense ofidentity.Trauma—In the context of ASD, a disastrous orlife-threatening event.essential feature is a traumatic event within one month ofthe onset of symptoms. Other diagnostic criteria include:• The symptoms significantly interfere with normalsocial or vocational functioning• The symptoms last between two days and four weeks.
Treatment
Treatment for acute stress disorder usually includesa combination of antidepressant medications and short-term psychotherapy.
Alternative treatment
Acupuncturehas been recommended as a treatmentfor acute stress disorder. Some other alternativeapproaches, including meditation, breathing exercises,and yoga, may be helpful when combined with short-term psychotherapy. Homeopathic treatment and the useof herbal medicine and flower essences also can help theperson with acute stress disorder rebalance on the physi-cal, mental, and emotional levels.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery is influenced by the sever-ity and duration of the trauma, the patient’s closeness to it,and the patient’s previous level of functioning. Favorablesigns include a short time period between the trauma andonset of symptoms, immediate treatment, and appropriatesocial support. If the patient’s symptoms are severeenough to interfere with normal life and have lasted longerthan one month, the diagnosis may be changed to PTSD.If the symptoms have lasted longer than one month but are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 49Acute stress disorderGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 49not severe enough to meet the definition of PTSD, thediagnosis may be changed to adjustment disorder.Patients who do not receive treatment for acutestress disorder are at increased risk for substance abuseor major depressive disorders.
Prevention
Traumatic events cannot usually be foreseen and,thus, cannot be prevented. However, in theory, profession-al intervention soon after a major trauma might reduce thelikelihood or severity of ASD. In addition, some symp-toms of acute stress disorder result from biochemicalchanges in the central nervous system, muscles, anddigestive tract that are not subject to conscious control.Resources

Addiction
Definition
Addiction is a dependence on a behavior or sub-stance that a person is powerless to stop. The term hasbeen partially replaced by the word dependencefor sub- stance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, toinclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Someresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substanceaddictions (for example,alcoholism, drug abuse, andsmoking); and process addictions (for example, gam-bling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).There is a growing recognition that many addicts, such aspolydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-stance or process.
Description
Addiction is one of the most costly public healthproblems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-drome, which means that it increases in severity overtime unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterizedby frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.Substance abusers often make repeated attempts to quitbefore they are successful.In 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in theUnited States exceeded $414 billion, with health carecosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at morethan $114 billion.By eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumedalcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% havesmoked marijuana. Compared to females, males arealmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearlyone and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more ofcigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuanaweekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-ferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-co,cocaineand heavy drinking appears to have remainedstable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.In 1999, an estimated four million Americans over theage of 12 used prescription painrelievers, sedatives, andstimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.In the United States, 25% of the population regularlyuses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times asmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-bined. According to 1998 data from the World HealthOrganization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwideand 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years areexposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which hasbeen implicated in sudden infant death syndrome,l o w birth weight,asthma, middle ear disease,pneumonia, cough, and upper respiratory infection.Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa,bulim- ia nervosa, and binge eating, affect over five millionAmerican women and men. Fifteen percent of youngwomen have substantially disordered attitudes towardeating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women dieeach year from anorexia nervosa.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 50AddictionGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50A 1997 Harvard study found that an estimated 15.4million Americans suffered from a gambling addiction.Over half that number (7.9 million) were adolescents.
Causes and symptoms
Addiction to substances results from the interactionof several factors:Drug chemistrySome substances are more addictive than others,either because they produce a rapid and intense change inmood; or because they produce painful withdrawalsymptoms when stopped suddenly.Genetic factorSome people appear to be more vulnerable to addic-tion because their body chemistry increases their sensi-tivity to drugs. Some forms of substance abuse anddependenceseem to run in families; and this may be theresult of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-ences, or a combination of both.Brain structure and functionUsing drugs repeatedly over time changes brainstructure and function in fundamental and long-lastingways. Addiction comes about through an array ofchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lastingbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-nitive and emotional functioning that characterizeaddicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.Although the causes of addiction remain the subject ofongoing debate and research, many experts now consideraddiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused bypersistent changes in brain structure and function. How-ever, having this brain disease does not absolve theaddict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it doesexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs bysheer force of will alone.Social learningSocial learning is considered the most important sin-gle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-ly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or mediainfluence.AvailabilityInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, ordrugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.Individual developmentBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personalitywas used to explain the development of addiction. Theaddictive personality was described as escapist, impul-sive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-tered. Many doctors now believe that these charactertraits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,rather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.
Diagnosis
In addition to a preoccupation with using andacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-tion is based on five criteria:• loss of willpower• harmful consequences• unmanageable lifestyle• tolerance or escalation of use• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting

Addiction—Dependence on a habit-forming sub-stance or behavior that the person is powerless tostop.Addictive personality—A concept that was for-merly used to explain addiction as the result ofpre-existing character defects in individuals.Process addiction—Addiction to certain mood-altering behaviors, such as eating disorders, gam-bling, sexual activity, overwork, and shopping.Tolerance—A condition in which an addict needshigher doses of a substance to achieve the sameeffect previously achieved with a lower dose.Withdrawal—The unpleasant, sometimes life-threatening physiological changes that occur, dueto the discontinuation of use of some drugs afterprolonged, regular use.Treatment
Treatment requires both medical and socialapproaches. Substance addicts may need hospital treat-ment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual orgroup psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after sub-stance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications, suchas methadoneand naltrexone, are also commonly used.The most frequently recommended social form ofoutpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Suchprograms are also frequently combined with psychother-apy. According to a recent study reported by the Ameri-can Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardlessof his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,can benefit from participation in 12-step programs suchas Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anony-mous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-helpgroups exceeds the number of visits to all mental healthprofessionals combined. There are twelve-step groupsfor all major substance and process addictions.The Twelve Steps are:• Admit powerlessness over the addiction.• Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restoresanity.• Make a decision to turn your will and your life over tothe care of God, as you understand him.• Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self.• Admit to God, yourself, and another human being theexact nature of your wrongs.• Become willing to have God remove all these defectsfrom your character.• Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.• Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs andbecome willing to make amends to them all.• Make direct amends to such people, whenever possibleexcept when to do so would injure them or others.• Continue to take personal inventory and promptlyadmit any future wrongdoings.• Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’sunderstanding through meditationand prayer.• Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others andpractice these principles in all your affairs.
Alternative treatment
Acupunctureand homeopathyhave been used totreat withdrawal symptoms. Meditation,yoga, and reiki healing have been recommended for process addictions,however, the success of these programs has not been welldocumented through controlled studies.Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery from any addictiondepends on the substance or process, the individual’s cir-cumstances, and underlying personality structure. Poly-drug users have the worst prognosis for recovery.
Prevention
The most effective form of prevention appears to bea stable family that models responsible attitudes towardmood-altering substances and behaviors. Prevention edu-cation programs are also widely used to inform the pub-lic of the harmfulness of substance abuse.Resources

Addison’s disease
Definition
Addison’s disease is a disorder involving disruptedfunctioning of the part of the adrenal gland called thecortex. This results in decreased production of twoimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released bythe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.
Description
The adrenals are two glands, each perched on theupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the glandis known as the cortex; the inner part is known as themedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland isresponsible for producing different types of hormones.Cortisol is a very potent hormone produced by theadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioningof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout thebody, and is considered to be one of the few hormonesabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-ents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins• the normal functioning of the circulatory system andthe heartKEY TERMS
Gland—A collection of cells whose function is torelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which areimportant to the functioning of other, sometimesdistantly located, organs or body systems.Hormone—A chemical produced in one part ofthe body, which travels to another part of the bodyin order to exert its effect.• the functioning of muscles• normal kidney function• production of blood cells• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-tal system• proper functioning of the brain and nerves• the normal responses of the immune systemAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-portions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-ance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughoutthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by adrop in blood pressure.Addison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-cal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferesdirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produceits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosteronedrop, and numerous functions throughout the body aredisrupted.Addison’s disease occurs in about four in every100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of Addison’s disease is thedestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenalcortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy isbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In anautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,responsible for identifying foreign invaders such asviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally beginsto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, anddestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction ofthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The remaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused byfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomy-cosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenalgland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53Addison’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis,i n which a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited inabnormal places throughout the body, interfering withthe function of whatever structure it is present within; orinvasion of the adrenal glands by cancer.In about 75% of all patients, Addison’s diseasetends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease.Significant symptoms are not noted until about 90% ofthe adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The most com-mon symptoms include fatigueand loss of energy,decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness,dizzi- nesswhen standing,dehydration, unusual areas ofdarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As thedisease progresses, the patient may appear to have verytanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining ofthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentationof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydrationbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continueto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak andlight-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-toms, including depression and irritability. Women losepubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-strual periods.When a patient becomes ill with an infection, orstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly andrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptomsof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heartrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-trollable nausea and vomiting, a drastic drop in bloodpressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified dueto the development of Addisonian crisis.
Diagnosis
Many patients do not recognize the slow progres-sion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identifiedwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-tation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of bloodtests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It isnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,patients are given a testing dose of another hormonecalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels.To distinguish between primary adrenocorticalinsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH inthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels ofACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to thepresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis ofAddison’s disease.Treatment
Treatment of Addison’s disease involves replacingthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potentform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in avein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss willalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-tions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressuremay require special medications to safely elevate it untilthe steroids take effect.Patients with Addison’s disease will need to take asteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacementfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest oftheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causesnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold downtheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medicalfacility where IV medications can be administered.When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, thenormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.
Prognosis
Prognosis for patients appropriately treated withhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. Thesepatients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Withouttreatment, or with substandard treatment, patients arealways at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.Resources

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 54Addison’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 54Adenoid hyperplasia
Definition
Adenoid hyperplasia is the overenlargement of thelymph glands located above the back of the mouth.
Description
Located at the back of the mouth above and belowthe soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands. The tonsilsbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-noids lie just above them and are hidden from view by thepalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defenseguard the major entrance to the body from foreigninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to therest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches itsgreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. Inthis way children are best able to develop the immunitiesthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.Beyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissuegrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-tion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fightoff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to itsformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind alarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make mattersworse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophiedglands can produce safe havens for germs where thebody cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi- oticsand the reduction in infectious childhood diseasesover the past few generations, tonsils and adenoidscaused greater health problems.
Causes and symptoms
Most tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simplycaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-sue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throatinfections by cold viruses,strep throat, mononucleosis,and in times gone by,diphtheria. The acute infectionsare usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids gettinglittle recognition because they cannot be seen withoutspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, brightred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes(glands) beneath the jaw,fever, and general discomfort.After the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-erated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely largetonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although thatis quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathingand require a child to breathe through the mouth. Becausethey encircle the only connection between the middle earand the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can alsoobstruct it and cause middle ear infections.KEY TERMS
Eustacian tube—A tube connecting the middle earwith the back of the nose, allowing air pressure toequalize within the ear whenever it opens, such aswith yawning.Hyperplastic—Overgrown.Hypertrophy—Overgrowth.Strep throat—An infection of the throat caused bybacteria of the Streptococcusfamily, which causestonsillitis.Ulcerated—Damaged so that the surface tissue islost and/or necrotic (dead).
Diagnosis
A simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allowsan adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils mayhave deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-ror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle earinfections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-tureor mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-ty of the germ.
Treatment
It used to be standard practice to remove tonsilsand/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or earinfection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-noidectomy(T and A). Opinion changed as it was realizedthat this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-ty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-duce only half the immunity to oral poliovaccine. In addi-tion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibioticsand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainagethrough the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reducedthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.
Alternative treatment
There are many botanical/herbal remedies that canbe used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsilsand adenoids in their immune function at the opening ofthe oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping theEustachian tubes open is an important contribution tooptimal function in the tonsils and adenoids. Food aller- giesare often the culprits for recurring ear infections, aswell as tonsilitis and adenoiditis. Identification andremoval of the allergic food(s) can greatly assist in alle-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 55Adenoid hyperplasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 55viating the cause of the problem. Acute tonsillitis alsobenefits from warm saline gargles.
Prognosis
Hypertrophied adenoids are a normal part of grow-ing up and should be respected for their important role inthe development of immunity. Only when their size caus-es problems by obstructing breathing or middle eardrainage do they demand intervention.
Prevention
Prevention can be directed toward prompt evaluationand appropriate treatment of sore throats to prevent over-growth of adenoid tissue. Avoiding other children withacute respiratory illness will also reduce the spread ofthese common illnesses.Resources

Adenovirus infections
Definition
Adenoviruses are DNA viruses (small infectiousagents) that cause upper respiratory tract infections, con- junctivitis, and other infections in humans.Description
Adenoviruses were discovered in 1953. About 47 dif-ferent types have been identified since then, and abouthalf of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infantsand children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-es. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,but seem to be most common from fall to spring.Adenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-piratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-nesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to causeinfection among military recruits and other young peoplewho live in institutional environments. Outbreaks amongchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools andsummer camps.Acquired immunityMost children have been infected by at least oneadenovirus by the time they reach school age. Mostadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirustypes due to infections they had as children.In one mode of adenovirus infection (called lyticinfection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-noviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-lion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-tious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. Inchronic or latent infection, a much smaller number ofviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply morerapidly than they are destroyed. People who have thiskind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probablywhy many adults have immunity to adenoviruses withoutrealizing they have been infected.Childhood infectionsIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acuteupper respiratory infections with feverand runny nose.Adenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible formost of these infections. Occasionally more seriouslower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, may occur.Adenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctivalfever in children. This disease is most often caused bytypes 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly andusually disappear in less than a week, include:• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)•f e v e r•sore throat(pharyngitis)• runny nose• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervicaladenitis)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 56Adenovirus infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56Adenoviruses also cause acute diarrheain young children, characterized by fever and watery stools. Thiscondition is caused by adenovirus types 40 and 41 andcan last as long as two weeks.As much as 51% of all hemorrhagic cystitis(inflam- mation of the bladder and of the tubes that carry urine tothe bladder from the kidneys) in American and Japanesechildren can be attributed to adenovirus infection. Achild who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine forabout three days, and invisible traces of blood can befound in the urine a few days longer. The child will feelthe urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to doso—for about the same length of time.Adult infectionsIn adults, the most frequently reported adenovirusinfection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused bytypes 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-toms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough are almost always present; weakness, chills,headache, and swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.The symptoms typically last three to five days.Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-novirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyardworkers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips ofrust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye-lid and covering the front of the eyeball can also becaused by using contaminated contact lens solutions orby drying the hands or face with a towel used by some-one who has this infection.The inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con-junctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and lastbetween one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of patients withepidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience respiratorysymptoms. One or both eyes may be affected. As symp-toms of conjunctivitis subside, eye painand wateringand blurred vision develop. These symptoms of keratitis may last for several months, and about 10% of theseinfections spread to at least one other member of thepatient’s household.Other illnesses associated with adenovirus include:• encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and otherinfections of the central nervous system (CNS)• gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intes-tines)• acute mesenteric lymphadenitis(inflammation oflymph glands in the abdomen)• chronic interstitial fibrosis (abnormal growth of con-nective tissue between cells)• intussusception (a type of intestinal obstruction)KEY TERMS
Conjunctivitis—Inflammation of the conjunctiva,the mucous membrane lining the inner surfaces ofthe eyelid and the front of the eyeball.Virus—A small infectious agent consisting of acore of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surround-ed by a shell of protein.• pneumonia that doesn’t respond to antibiotic therapy•whooping coughsyndrome when Bordetella pertussis(the bacterium that causes classic whooping cough) isnot found
Causes and symptoms
Specific adenovirus infections can be traced to par-ticular sources and produce distinctive symptoms. Ingeneral, however, adenovirus infection is caused by:• inhaling airborne viruses• getting the virus in the eyes by swimming in contami-nated water, using contaminated eye solutions or instru-ments, wiping the eyes with contaminated towels, orrubbing the eyes with contaminated fingers.• not washing the hands after using the bathroom, andthen touching the mouth or eyesSymptoms common to most types of adenovirusinfections include:• cough•f e v e r• runny nose• sore throat• watery eyes
Diagnosis
Although symptoms may suggest the presence ofadenovirus, distinguishing these infections from otherviruses can be difficult. A definitive diagnosis is based onculture or detection of the virus in eye secretions, spu-tum, urine, or stool.The extent of infection can be estimated from theresults of blood tests that measure increases in the quan-tity of antibodies the immune system produces to fight it.Antibody levels begin to rise about a week after infectionoccurs and remain elevated for about a year.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 57Adenovirus infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 57Treatment
Treatment of adenovirus infections is usually sup-portive and aimed at relieving symptoms of the illness.Bed rest may be recommended along with medications toreduce fever and/or pain. (Aspirinshould not be given tochildren because of concerns about Reye’s syndrome.)Eye infections may benefit from topical corticosteroidsto relieve symptoms and shorten the course of the dis-ease. Hospitalization is usually required for severe pneu-monia in infants and for EKC (to prevent blindness). Noeffective antiviral drugshave been developed.
Prognosis
Adenovirus infections are rarely fatal. Most patientsrecover fully.
Prevention
Practicing good personal hygiene and avoiding peo-ple with infectious illnesses can reduce the risk of devel-oping adenovirus infection. Proper handwashing can pre-vent the spread of the virus by oral-fecal transmission.Sterilization of instruments and solutions used in the eyecan prevent the spread of EKC, as can adequate chlorina-tion of swimming pools.A vaccine containing live adenovirus types 4 and 7is used to control disease in military recruits, but it is notrecommended or available for civilian use. Vaccines pre-pared from purified subunits of adenovirus are underinvestigation.Resources

Adjustment disorders
Definition
An adjustment disorder is a debilitating reaction,usually lasting less than six months, to a stressful eventor situation. It is not the same thing as post-traumaticstress disorder(PTSD), which usually occurs in reac-tion to a life-threatening event and can be longer lasting.Description
An adjustment disorder usually begins within threemonths of a stressful event, and ends within six monthsafter the stressor stops. There are many different sub-types of adjustment disorders, including adjustment dis-order with:• depression•anxiety• mixed anxiety and depression• conduct disturbances• mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct• unspecifiedAdjustment disorders are very common and canaffect anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or lifestyle.By definition, an adjustment disorder is short-lived,unless a person is faced with a chronic recurring crisis(such as a child who is repeatedly abused). In such cases,the adjustment disorder may last more than six months.
Causes and symptoms
An adjustment disorder occurs when a person can’tcope with a stressful event and develops emotional orbehavioral symptoms. The stressful event can be anything:it might be just one isolated incident, or a string of prob-lems that wears the person down. The stressmight be any-thing from a car accident or illness, to a divorce, or even acertain time of year (such as Christmas or summer).People with adjustment disorder may have a widevariety of symptoms. How those symptoms combinedepend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorderand on the individual’s personality and psychologicaldefenses. Symptoms normally include some (but not all)of the following:• hopelessness• sadness• crying• anxiety• worry• headaches or stomachaches• withdrawal• inhibition• truancy• vandalism• reckless driving• fighting• other destructive acts
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 58Adjustment disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 58Diagnosis
It is extremely important that a thorough evaluationrule out other more serious mental disorders, since thetreatment for adjustment disorder may be very differentthan for other mental problems.In order to be diagnosed as a true adjustment disor-der, the level of distress must be more severe than whatwould normally be expected in response to the stressor,or the symptoms must significantly interfere with a per-son’s social, job, or school functioning. Normal expres-sion of grief, in bereavement for instance, is not consid-ered an adjustment disorder.
Treatment
Psychotherapy (counseling) is the treatment ofchoice for adjustment disorders, since the symptoms arean understandable reaction to a specific stress. The typeof therapy depends on the mental health expert, but itusually is short-term treatment that focuses on resolvingthe immediate problem.Therapy usually will help clients:• develop coping skills• understand how the stressor has affected their lives• develop alternate social or recreational activitiesFamily or couples therapy may be helpful in somecases. Medications are not usually used to treat adjust-ment disorders, although sometimes a few days or weeksof an anti-anxiety drug can control anxiety or sleepingproblems.Self-help groups aimed at a specific problem (suchas recovering from divorce or job loss) can be extremelyhelpful to people suffering from an adjustment disorder.Social support, which is usually an important part of self-help groups, can lead to a quicker recovery.
Prognosis
Most people recover completely from adjustmentdisorders, especially if they had no previous history ofmental problems, and have a stable home life with strongsocial support. People with progressive or cyclic disor-ders (such as multiple sclerosis) may experience anadjustment disorder with each exacerbation period.Resources

Adrenal gland cancer
Definition
Adrenal gland cancers are rare cancers occuring inthe endocrine tissue of the adrenals. They are character-ized by overproduction of adrenal gland hormones.
Description
Cancers of the adrenal gland are very rare. Theadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine glandwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. Themain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and themain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.When tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secreteexcess amounts of these hormones. A cancerthat arisesin the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino-ma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain,excess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. Acancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy-tomaand can cause high blood pressure,headache,pal- pitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these can-cers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults.
Causes and symptoms
It is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,but some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 59Adrenal gland cancerGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 59Symptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specifichormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical car-cinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol, pro-ducing Cushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome producesprogressive weight gain, rounding of the face, andincreased blood pressure. Women can experience men-strual cycle alterations and men can experience feminiza-tion. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma includehypertension, acidosis, unexplained feverand weightloss. Because of the hormones produced by this type oftumor,anxietyis often a feature also.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins withblood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor-mones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone. Italso includes magnetic resonance imaging, and com- puted tomography scansto determine the extent of thedisease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect thehigh levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at removing the tumor bysurgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy. Surgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapyand/or radiation therapy. Because the surgery removes thesource of many important hormones, hormones must besupplemented following surgery. If adrenocortical cancerrecurs or has spread to other parts of the body (metasta-sized), additional surgery may be done followed bychemotherapy using the drug mitotane.KEY TERMS
Cortisol—A hormone produced by the adrenalcortex. It is partially responsible for regulatingblood sugar levels.Diabetes—A disease characterized by low bloodsugar.Epinephrine—A hormone produced by the adren-al medulla. It is important in the response to stressand partially regulates heart rate and metabolism.It is also called adrenaline.Laparoscopy—The insertion of a tube through theabdominal wall. It can be used to visualize theinside of the abdomen and for surgical procedures.Alternative treatment
As with any form of cancer, all conventional treat-ment options should be considered and applied as appro-priate. Nutritional support, as well as supporting the func-tioning of the entire person diagnosed with adrenal glandcancer through homeopathic medicine,acupuncture, vit- amin and mineral supplementation, and herbal medicine,can benefit recovery and enhance quality of life.
Prognosis
The prognosis for adrenal gland cancer is variable.For localized pheochromocytomas the 5-year survival rateis 95%. This rate decreases with aggressive tumors thathave metastasized. The prognosis for adrenal cortical can-cer is not as good with a 5-year survival rate of 10-35%.
Prevention
Since so little is known about the cause of adrenalgland cancer, it is not known if it can be prevented.Resources

Adrenal gland scan
Definition
The adrenal gland scan is a nuclear medicine evalua-tion of the medulla (inner tissue) of the adrenal gland.
Purpose
The adrenal glands are a pair of small organs locatedjust above the kidney, which contain two types of tissue.The adrenal cortex produces hormones that affect waterbalance and metabolism in the body. The adrenal medul-la produces adrenaline and noradrenaline (also calledepinepherine and norepinepherine).An adrenal gland scan is done when too muchadrenaline and noradrenaline is produced in the body and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 60Adrenal gland scanGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 60a tumor in the adrenal gland is suspected. One such situa-tion in which a tumor might be suspected is when highblood pressure (hypertension) does not respond to med-ication. Tumors that secrete adrenaline and noradrenalinecan also be found outside the adrenal gland. An adrenalgland scan usually covers the abdomen, chest, and head.
Precautions
Adrenal gland scans are not recommended for preg-nant women because of the potential harm to the devel-oping fetus. A pregnant woman should discuss with herdoctor the risks of the procedure against the benefits ofthe information it can provide in evaluating her individ-ual medical situation.People who have recently undergone tests that usebarium must wait until the barium has been eliminatedfrom their system in order to obtain accurate results fromthe adrenal gland scan.
Description
The adrenal gland scan takes several days. On thefirst day, a radiopharmaceutical is injected intravenouslyinto the patient. On the second, third, and fourth day thepatient is positioned under the camera for imaging. Thescanning time each day takes approximately 30 minutes.It is essential that the patient remain still during imaging.Occasionally, the scanning process may involvefewer than three days, or it may continue several dayslonger. The area scanned extends from the pelvis andlower abdomen to the lower chest. Sometimes the upperlegs, thighs, and head are also included.
Preparation
For two days before and ten days after the injectionof the radiopharmaceutical, patients are given eitherLugol’s solution or potassium iodine. This prevents thethyroid from taking up radioactive iodine and interferingwith the scan.
Aftercare
The patient should not feel any adverse effects of thetest and can resume normal activity immediately. Follow-up tests that might be ordered include a nuclear scan ofthe bones or kidney, a computed tomography scan (CT)of the adrenals, or an ultrasound of the pelvic area.
Risks
The main risk associated with this test is to the fetusof a pregnant woman.KEY TERMS
Adrenal cortex—The outer tissue of the adrenalgland. It produces a group of chemically relatedhormones called corticosteroids that control min-eral and water balance in the body and includealdosterone and cortisol.Adrenal medulla—The inner tissue of the adrenalgland. It produces the hormones adrenaline andnoradrenaline.Lugol’s solution—A strong iodine solution.
Normal results
Normal results will show no unusual areas of hor-mone secretion and no tumors.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results will show evidence of a tumorwhere there is excessive secretion of adrenaline or nora-drenaline. Over 90% of these tumors are in the abdomen.Resources

Adrenal virilism
Definition
Adrenal virilism is the development or prematuredevelopment of male secondary sexual characteristicscaused by male sex hormones (androgens) excessivelyproduced by the adrenal gland. This disorder can occurbefore birth and can lead to sexual abnormalities in new-borns. It can also occur in girls and women later in life.
Description
In the normal human body, there are two adrenalglands. They are small structures that lie on top of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 61Adrenal virilismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 61kidneys. The adrenal glands produce many hormonesthat regulate body functions. These hormones includeandrogens, or male hormones. Androgens are producedin normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or both ofthe adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro-ducing more than the usual amount of androgens. Theexcess androgens create masculine characteristics.
Causes and symptoms
In infants and children, adrenal virilism is usuallythe result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present atbirth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The cause is usually a genetic problem that leads tosevere enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril-ism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor canbe benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car-cinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type oftumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).Newborn girls with adrenal virilism have externalsex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and femaleorgans (called female pseudohermaphrodism). Newbornboys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs,and these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace.Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begingrowing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlierthan normal. Later in childhood, they are typically short-er than normal but have well-developed trunks.Women with adrenal virilization may develop facialhair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent orabsent. They may also develop a deeper voice, a moreprominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.
Diagnosis
Endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in thediagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have themost expertise to deal with adrenal virilization. SomeKEY TERMS
Glucocorticoid—A hormone produced by theadrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increasein blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules bythe liver.Hydrocortisone—A hormone in the group of glu-cocorticoid hormones.Prednisone—A drug that functions as a glucocorti-coid hormone.doctors who treat disorders of the internal organs(internists) and doctors who specialize in treating thereproductive system of women (gynecologists) may alsobe able to help patients with this disorder.Diagnosis involves performing many laboratorytests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea-sure the concentration of different hormones. Differentabnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a differentpattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can alsohelp determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If atumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-ize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend onobtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), andexamining it under a microscope in order to verify itscharacteristics.
Treatment
Adrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia istreated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usuallyprednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-tisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-ed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls withpseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make theirexternal sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor iscausing the disorder, the treatment will depend on thetype and location of the tumor. Information about thetumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used todecide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient.If the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require specialtreatment depending on how far the cancerhas advanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery,medications used to kill cancer cells (chemotherapy), and x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancercells (radiation therapy). Sometimes the doctor mustremove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. Ifthe tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumormay be the best option.
Prognosis
Ongoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controlsadrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but thereis no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder,patients have a better prognosis if they have an early stageof cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread.Resources

Adrenalectomy
Definition
Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one orboth of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are pairedendocrine glands, one located above each kidney, thatproduce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-lectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may uselaparoscopy. With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can beaccomplished through four very small incisions.
Purpose
Adrenalectomy is usually advised for patients withtumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors maybe malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessiveamounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-dure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and mayalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other partsof the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-mended when hormones produced by the adrenal glandsaggravate another condition such as breast cancer.
Precautions
The adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-sels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleedingduring surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close toone of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),and to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs toremove the gland(s) without damaging any of theseimportant and delicate organs.
Description
Open adrenalectomyThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-tions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’sbody type.In the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into theabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operateon only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will rununder just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-times a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomenprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenalglands are involved.In the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into theback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to beremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.This approach is the most direct route to the adrenalglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of thesurrounding structures as the anterior approach.In the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into thepatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obesepatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeonmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn thepatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.The last approach involves an incision into the chestcavity, either with or without part of the incision into theabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipatesa very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine orremove nearby structures as well.Laparoscopic adrenalectomyThis technique does not require the surgeon to openthe body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2in diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, justunder the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-geon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on atelevision monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.The other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturizedversions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to beoperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-side the body.
Preparation
Most aspects of preparation are the same as in othermajor operations. In addition, hormone imbalances areoften a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicianswill try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-tion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumorsmay cause other problems such as hypertensionor inad- equate potassium in the blood, and these problems alsoshould be resolved if possible before surgery is per-formed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicinesfor days or weeks before surgery.Most adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with aCT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-ent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeonsmay order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing ofthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to helplocate exactly where the tumor is.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 63AdrenalectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 63The day before surgery, patients will probably havean enema to clear the bowels. In patients with lung prob-lems or clotting problems, physicians may advise specialpreparations.
Aftercare
Patients stay in the hospital for various lengths oftime after adrenalectomy. The longest hospital stays arerequired for open surgery using an anterior approach;hospital stays of about three days are indicated for opensurgery using the posterior approach or for laparoscopicadrenalectomy.The special concern after adrenalectomy is thepatient’s hormone balance. There may be several sets oflab tests to define hormone problems and monitor theresults of drug treatment. In addition, blood pressureproblems and infections are more common after removalof certain types of adrenal tumors.As with most open surgery, surgeons are also con-cerned about blood clots forming in the legs and travel-ing to the lungs (venous thromboembolism), bowel prob-lems, and postoperative pain. With laparoscopic adrena-lectomy, these problems are somewhat less difficult, butthey are still present.
Risks
The special risks of adrenalectomy involve majorhormone imbalances, caused by the underlying disease,KEY TERMS

Adrenocorticotropic hormonetest
Definition
Adrenocorticotropic hormone test (also known as anACTH test or a corticotropin test) measures pituitarygland function.
Purpose
The pituitary gland produces the hormone ACTH,which stimulates the outer layer of the adrenal gland (theadrenal cortex). ACTH causes the release of the hormoneshydrocortisone (cortisol), aldosterone, and androgen. Themost important of these hormones released is cortisol.The ACTH test is used to determine if too much cortisolis being produced (Cushing’s syndrome) or if notenough cortisol is being produced (Addison’s disease).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 64Adrenocorticotropic hormone testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 64Precautions
ACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the levelsof this hormone vary according to the time of day. Thehighest levels occur in the morning hours. Testing fornormal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s disease, mayrequire multiple samples. For sequential follow-up, ablood sample analyzed for ACTH should always bedrawn at the same time each day.ACTH can be directly measured by an analyzingmethod (immunoassay) in many large laboratories. How-ever, smaller laboratories are usually not equipped to per-form this test and they may need to send the blood sam-ple to a larger laboratory. Because of this delay, resultsmay take several days to obtain.
Description
ACTH production is partly controlled by an area inthe center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partlycontrolled by the level of cortisol in the blood. WhenACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increasesto suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. IfACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus producescorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate thepituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels rise inresponse to stress, emotions, injury, infection,burns, surgery, and decreased blood pressure.Cushing’s syndromeCushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally highlevel of circulating hydrocortisone. The high level may bethe result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement ofboth adrenal glands due to a pituitary tumor. The highlevel of hydrocortisone may be the result of taking corti-costeroid drugs for a long time. Corticosteroid drugs arewidely used for inflammation in disorders like rheuma- toid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma. Addison’s diseaseAddison’s disease is a rare disorder in whichsymptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocorti-sone and aldosterone. The most common cause of thisdisease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune sys-tem normally fights foreign invaders in the body likebacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune sys-tems attacks the body. In this case, the immune systemproduces antibodies that attack the adrenal glands.Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, withsymptoms developing gradually over months or years.However, acute episodes, called Addisonian crises, arebrought on by infection, injury, or other stresses. Diag-nosis is generally made if the patient fails to respond toKEY TERMS
Adrenal glands—A pair of endocrine glands thatlie on top of the kidneys.Pituitary gland—The most important of theendocrine glands, glands that release hormonesdirectly into the bloodstream; sometimes calledthe master gland.an injection of ACTH, which normally stimulates thesecretion of hydrocortisone.
Preparation
A person’s ACTH level is determined from a bloodsample. The patient must fast from midnight until the testthe next morning. This means that the patient cannot eator drink anything after midnight except water. The patientmust also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recentlyadministered radioisotopes prior to the blood test.
Risks
The risks associated with this test are minimal. Theymay include slight bleeding from the location where theblood was drawn. The patient may feel faint or lighthead-ed after the blood is drawn. Sometimes the patient mayhave an accumulation of blood under the puncture site(hematoma) after the test.
Normal results
Each laboratory will have its own set of normal val-ues for this test. The normal values can range from:Morning (4-8 
A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI units)Evening (8-10 
P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less than 50ng/L (SI units)
Abnormal results
In Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH maybe caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumorsmay be either in the pituitary or in another area (liketumors from lung canceror ovarian cancer). Low ACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement dueto high levels of cortisol and feedback to the pituitary.In Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may becaused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases decreaseadrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts to increasefunctioning. Low levels of ACTH may occur because ofdecreased pituitary function.

Adrenoleukodystrophy
Definition
Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare genetic diseasecharacterized by a loss of myelin surrounding nerve cellsin the brain and progressive adrenal gland dysfunction.
Description
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a member of agroup of diseases, leukodystrophies, that cause damageto the myelin sheath of nerve cells. Approximately one in100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basicforms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. Thechildhood form of the disease is the classical form and isthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-ally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boysbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the Xchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages fourand ten and can include many different symptoms, not allof which appear together. The most common symptomsare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-toms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorlyarticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-lems with gait and coordination,fatigue, increased skinpigmentation, and progressive dementia.The adult-onset form of the disease, also calledadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, isusually associated with a normal life span, and usuallyappears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may includeprogressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysisof the lowerlimbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-tion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of thedisease occasionally experience the same symptoms, aswell as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessivemuscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinaryproblems. The neonatal form affects both male andfemale infants and may produce mental retardation, facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poormuscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.Neonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.
Causes and symptoms
The genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in theability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These buildup in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.The build-up of very long chain fatty acids interfereswith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-terol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves inthe white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cellsare unable to function properly.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, abiochemical test, and a family history. The biochemicaltest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acidsin samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi, plasma,red blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-cate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carriedon the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.
Treatment
Treatment for all forms of ALD consists of treatingthe symptoms and supporting the patient with physicaltherapy, psychological counseling, and special educationin some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and thereare no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve andbrain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing theintake of foods high in fat, which are a source of verylong chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oilhas been shown to reduce the level of long chain fattyacids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 66Adrenoleukodystrophy3GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 66is unaffected. Experimental bone marrow transplanta-tionhas not been very effective.
Prognosis
Prognosis for childhood and neonatal ALD patientsis poor because of the progressive myelin degeneration.Death usually occurs between one and ten years afteronset of symptoms.
Prevention
Since ALD is a genetic disease, prevention is largelylimited to genetic counselingand fetal monitoringthrough amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Resources

Adult respiratory distresssyndrome
Definition
Adult respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), alsocalled acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type oflung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis-ease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in thelungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-drome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up oneof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-ure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whoselungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is atrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdownof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluidfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lunginto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).
Description
Another name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formalname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).This is the all-important site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all partsof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS isone of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, theother being heart failure.Along with fluid there is a marked increase ininflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left overfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-al derived from blood in the tissues. Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the blood(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-branes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often calledhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather becomescarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower, and in time they, too, maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungsas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes muchharder for the patient to breathe.
Causes and symptoms
A very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,including some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents whenregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearlydrowning.• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,such as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-gen, which itself can injure the lungs.• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a wide-spread infection that gets into the blood.• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of thebody.• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not initself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-cular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vesselsthroughout the body, including the lungs.• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-eling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-sels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,aspirin.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 67Adult respiratory distress syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67• Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), when blood proteins, called enzymes, pass to the lungs andinjure lung cells.• Severe burn injury.• Injury of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, from anycause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that are notclear. Convulsions also may cause some cases.Usually ARDS develops within one to two days of theoriginal illness or injury. The person begins to take rapidbut shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’schest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez- ingsounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause theskin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues tofill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great troublebreathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.
Diagnosis
A simple test using a device applied to the ear willshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, andthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from anartery. The chest x raymay be normal in the early stages,but, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does notbelong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heartof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDSand not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-guish between these two possibilities is to place a catheterKEY TERMS
Alveoli—The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-ing tubes of the lung where oxygen normally istaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.Aspiration—The process in which solid food, liq-uids, or secretions that normally are swallowedare, instead, breathed into the lungs.Capillaries—The smallest arteries which, in thelung, are located next to the alveoli so that theycan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.Face mask—The simplest way of delivering a highlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or otherlow-oxygen conditions.Steroids—A class of drugs resembling normalbody substances that often help control inflamma-tion in the body tissues.Ventilator—A mechanical device that can takeover the work of breathing for a patient whoselungs are injured or are starting to heal.into a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.In this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillariescan be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-ies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.
Treatment
The three main goals in treating patients with ARDSare:• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.Examples are: to treat septic infection with the properantibiotics, and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy ifARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid toleak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-tain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones havebeen tried because they can combat inflammation, butthe actual results have been disappointing.• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until thelung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered bya face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on aventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through atube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in thewindpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatmentmust be closely supervised, and the pressure adjustedso that too much oxygen is not delivered.Patients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-sive care unit, where experienced staff and all neededequipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration. Also, thepatient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again byvein, if oral intake is not sufficient.
Prognosis
If the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin toheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,such as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterialpneumoniawill develop at some point. Without prompttreatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can beexpected to die. With modern treatment, however, abouthalf of all patients will survive. Those who do live usuallyrecover completely, with little or no long-term breathingdifficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on aventilator, but it may improve in the months after thepatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particularpatient will recover depends to a great extent on whetherthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in thefirst place can be effectively treated.
Prevention
The only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-eases and harmful conditions that damage the lung. For
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 68Adult respiratory distress syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 68instance, the danger of aspirating stomach contents intothe lungs can be avoided by making sure a patient does noteat shortly before receiving general anesthesia. If a patientneeds oxygen therapy, as low a level as possible should begiven. Any form of lung infection, or infection anywherein the body that gets into the blood, must be treatedpromptly to avoid the lung injury that causes ARDS.Resources

Aging
Definition
Starting at what is commonly called middle age, oper-ations of the human body begin to be more vulnerable todaily wear and tear; there is a general decline in physical,and possibly mental, functioning. In the Western countries,the length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit ofthe life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. Duringthe latter half of life, an individual is more prone to haveproblems with the various functions of the body and todevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-diovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductiveand urinary systems are particularly affected. The mostcommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.
Description
Human beings reach a peak of growth and develop-ment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normaltransition time after that flurry of activity. Although thereare quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-ability is not necessarily a part of aging. Health andlifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of theindividual, and determines the response to these changes.Body functions that are most often affected by age include:• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to thehighest pitched tones.• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase byas much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of bodyfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulatesaround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats isimpaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,including cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-fore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.Also, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,thus affecting the elimination of wastes.• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease instomach acid production.• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with anaccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,leading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughoutthe body.• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so thatnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-es are not as sharp, and memory and learning arediminished.• A decrease in bone strength and density.• Hormone levels, which gradually decline. The thyroidand sexual hormones are particularly affected.• Declining visual abilities. Age-related changes maylead to diseases such as macular degeneration.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 69AgingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 69• A compromised ability to produce vitamin D from sun-light.• A reduction in protein formation leading to shrinkagein muscle mass and decreased bone formation, possiblyleading to osteoporosis.
Causes and symptoms
There are several theories as to why the aging bodyloses functioning. It may be that several factors worktogether or that one particular factor is at work more thanothers in a given individual.• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. Theaging of the cells of each individual is programmed intothe genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-venations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at arate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-tion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain thefunctions necessary for life.• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed ofdestruction at the level of the chromosomes.• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes inthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stabilityof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-tioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory ofaging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemicalreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-ence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of thebody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die orlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases tofunction as a whole.• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immunesystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is moreprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finallycause death. Also, as the system breaks down, the bodyis more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which thebody’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material andare destroyed or damaged by the immune system.
Diagnosis
Many problems can arise due to age-related changesin the body. Although there is no one test to be given, athorough physical exam and a basic blood screening andblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-ther attention. When older people become ill, the firstsigns of disease are often nonspecific. Further examsshould be conducted if any of the following occur:• diminished or lack of desire for food• increasing confusion• failure to thrive• urinary incontinence• dizziness• weight loss• fallingTreatment
For the most part, doctors prescribe medications tocontrol the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-ed States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over takemedications for various complaints. More women thanmen use these medications. The most common drugsused by the elderly are painkillers,diureticsor water pills, sedatives, cardiac drugs,antibiotics, and mentalhealth drugs.Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonlyprescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms ofaging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.ERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk ofheart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improveskin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also helpmaintain mental functions.
Expected results
Aging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-ment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free lifewell through their later years. A well established supportsystem of family, friends, and health care providers,together with focus on good nutritionand lifestylehabits and good stressmanagement, can prevent diseaseand lessen the impact of chronic conditions.
Alternative treatment
Nutritional supplementsConsumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-ommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connectedwith aging include B vitamins, vitamins A and C,folic acid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, andtrace minerals. Since stomach acids may be decreased, itis suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-mula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-est to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymesfor further help with digestion.Antioxidants can help to neutralize damage by thefree radical actions thought to contribute to problems ofaging. They are also helpful in preventing and treatingcancer and in treating cataractsand glaucoma. Supple- ments that serve as antioxidants include:

How-ever, caution should be taken before beginning treatment,and the patient should consult his or her health care pro-fessional.DHEA improves brain functioning and serves as abuilding block for many other important hormones in thebody. It may be helpful in restoring declining hormonelevels and in building up muscle mass, strengthening thebones, and maintaining a healthy heart.Melatonin may be helpful for insomnia. It has alsobeen used to help fight viruses and bacterial infections,reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sexual function-ing, and to protect against cancer.Human growth hormone (hGH) has been shown toregulate blood sugar levels and to stimulate bone, carti-lage, and muscle growth while reducing fat.HerbsGarlic (Allium sativa) is helpful in preventing heartdisease, as well as improving the tone and texture ofskin.

Preventive health practices such as healthy diet,daily exercise, stress management, and control oflifestyle habits such as smokingand drinking, canlengthen the life span and improve the quality of life aspeople age. Exercise can improve the appetite, the healthof the bones, the emotional and mental outlook, and thedigestion and circulation.Drinking plenty of fluids aids in maintaining healthyskin, good digestion, and proper elimination of wastes.Up to eight glasses of water should be consumed daily,along with plenty of herbal teas, diluted fruit and veg-etable juices, and fresh fruits and vegetables with highwater content.Because of a decrease in the sense of taste, olderpeople often increase their intake of salt, which can con-tribute to high blood pressure and nutrient loss. Use ofsugar is also increased. Seaweeds and small amounts ofhoney can be used as replacements.Alcohol, nicotine, and caffeineall have potentialdamaging effects, and should be limited or completelyeliminated from consumption.A diet high in fiber and low in fat is recommended.Processed foods should be replaced by complex carbohy-drates, such as whole grains. If chewing becomes a prob-lem, there should be an increased intake of protein drinks,freshly juiced fruits and vegetables, and creamed cereals.Resources

Agoraphobia
Definition
The word agoraphobia is derived from Greek wordsliterally meaning “fear of the marketplace.” The term isused to describe an irrational and often disabling fear ofbeing out in public.
Description
Agoraphobia is just one type of phobia, or irrationalfear. People with phobiasfeel dread or panic when theyface certain objects, situations, or activities. People withagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, butpanic attacks, or panic disorder, are not a requirementfor a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature ofagoraphobia is anxietyabout being in places from whichescape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in whichhelp might be unavailable. The person suffering fromagoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-tion and may become totally housebound.
Causes and symptoms
Agoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, andit is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans withintheir lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in womenas in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.The symptoms of the panic attacks which mayaccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, andmay include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations(a feeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapidpulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.Agoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be theresult of a number of physical and environmental factors.For instance, they have been associated with biochemicalimbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-ters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. Peoplewho have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-ping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-uation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,irrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-flicts. All of these factors may play a role to varyingextents in different cases of agoraphobia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 72AgoraphobiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72Diagnosis
People who suffer from panic attacks should discussthe problem with a physician. The doctor can diagnosethe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make surethe symptoms aren’t related to some other underlyingmedical condition.The doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobiabased primarily on the patient’s description of his or hersymptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiencesanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help isunavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.While many people are somewhat apprehensive in thesesituations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’sactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or herability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.
Treatment
Treatment for agoraphobia usually consists of bothmedication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients canbenefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-line (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-line (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panicattacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben- zodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon-azepam (Klonipin).The mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and otherphobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech-nique that is often employed is called desensitization.The patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu-ally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help ofbreathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope withthe situation. This helps break the mental connectionbetween the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic.Patients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori-ented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotionalconflicts with a therapist or support group.
Prognosis
With proper medication and psychotherapy, 90% ofpatients will find significant improvement in their symp-toms.Resources

AIDS
Definition
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is aninfectious disease caused by the human immunodeficien-cyvirus (HIV). It was first recognized in the United Statesin 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of infection with theHIV virus, which may not cause recognizable disease for along period after the initial exposure (latency). No vaccineis currently available to prevent HIV infection. At present,all forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving thequality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing orhalting the replication of the virus and treating or prevent-ing infections and cancers that take advantage of a per-son’s weakened immune system.
Description
AIDS is considered one of the most devastating publichealth problems in recent history. In June 2000, the Centers
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 73AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 73for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that120,223 (includes only those cases in areas that have confi-dential HIV reporting) in the United States are HIV-posi-tive, and 311,701 are living with AIDS (includes only thosecases where vital status is known). Of these patients, 44%are gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenousdrug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-ly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-tion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide wereliving with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million beingnewly infected that year. Most of these cases are in thedeveloping countries of Asia and Africa.Risk factorsAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The riskfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those whodo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-mous, those who participate in anal intercourse, andthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms ofadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-mitted diseases(STDs). In the United States andEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-tion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas inAfrica, the disease is spread primarily through sexualintercourse among heterosexuals.• Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers includewomen married to bisexual men or men who have anabnormal blood condition called hemophiliaand require blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, andwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIVinfection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-mitting the disease to the child are higher in women inadvanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increasesthe risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-dine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decreasethe risk of transmission to the baby.• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.With the introduction of blood product screening in themid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in bloodtransfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-fused. With respect to HIV transmission among drugabusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-tions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number ofpersons who share a needle, and the number of AIDScases in the local population.• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Presentstudies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-dle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased ifthe injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-tion, in combination with other medication.HIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-al non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes.AIDS in womenAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.Women exposed to HIV infection through heterosexualcontact are the most rapidly growing risk group in theUnited States population. The percentage of AIDS casesdiagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in1999. Women diagnosed with AIDS may not live as longas men, although the reasons for this finding are unclear.

As of 2000, it was estimated that87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children bornto HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.AIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of deathin chil- dren between one and four years of age. The intervalbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS isshorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIVhave a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a yearand dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-gresses more slowly; the average child patient survives toseven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.
Causes and symptoms
Because HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDSis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organsystems. HIV attacks the body through three diseaseprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-vous system dysfunction.Immunodeficiency describes the condition in whichthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or isnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiencyresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein calledCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certainsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, thevirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptorcalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry ofthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-lar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showedthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-ment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of theCCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.Once HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-cellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-pletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-cytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of

(Photograph by Scott Camazir, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 75the remaining CD4 cells. Because the immune systemcells are destroyed, many different types of infectionsand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakenedimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.Autoimmunity is a condition in which the body’simmune system produces antibodies that work against itsown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced inresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, proteinor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-duces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-essary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Oncebound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal fromthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. SomeAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-relatedthrombocytopeniapurpura (ITP), in which the numberof blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.As of 2000, researchers do not know precisely howHIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can causedamage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theoryis that, once infected with HIV , one type of immune sys-tem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxinthat harms the nervous system.The course of AIDS generally progresses throughthree stages, although not all patients will follow thisprogression precisely:Acute retroviral syndromeAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describea group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosisand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%of all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients arenot recognized as infected during this phase and may notseek medical attention. The symptoms may includefever,fatigue, muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestivedisturbances, weight loss, skin rashes,headache, and chronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).Approximately 25-33% of patients will experience aform of meningitisduring this phase in which the mem-branes that cover the brain and spinal cord becomeinflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops betweenone and six weeks after infection and lasts for two tothree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicatethe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of theviral p24 antigen in the blood.Latency periodAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodesduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the diseasebecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more beforesymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,the virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, whereit may cause one or more of the following conditions:PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).
Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-dition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painlessswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.The lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGLare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.PGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.
CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients willdevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and generalweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of foodmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-lism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting orwasting syndrome.
OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during thecourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeastinfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,or other infections of the mouth; diarrheaand other gas-trointestinal symptoms that cause malnutritionand weight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; anddegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.HIV infection of the nervous system leads to general lossof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness orburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.Late-stage disease (AIDS)AIDS is usually marked by a very low number ofCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequencyof opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitorthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in thepatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of thedisease and the effectiveness of different medications.About 10% of infected individuals never progress to thisovert stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-gressors.
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’sCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm
3, he or she is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. Theinfectious organisms may include the following:• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associatedwith AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia(PCP). PCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% ofAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’sprognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeastinfection of the mouth (candidiasisor thrush) andcryptococcal meningitis.• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosisis a common opportunisticinfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-zoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasisand cryptosporidiosis.• Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may develop tuberculo-sisor MAC infections. MAC infections are caused by
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 76AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 76Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and occur inabout 40% of AIDS patients. It is rare until CD4+counts falls below 50 cells/mm
3.• Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacterialinfections of the skin and digestive tract.• Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable tocytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-gressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem, cere-brum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathyor PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-defining illnessby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-PLICATIONS.
AIDS dementiacomplex is usually a latecomplication of the disease. It is unclear whether it iscaused by the direct effects of the virus on the brain or byintermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is markedby loss of reasoning ability, loss of memory, inability toconcentrate, apathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadi-ness or weakness in walking. Some patients also developseizures. There are no specific treatments for AIDSdementia complex.MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients inlate-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-cles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-like pains in the joints.
ORAL SYMPTOMS. In addition to thrush and painfululcers in the mouth, patients may develop a conditioncalled hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This condition isalso regarded by the CDC as an indicator of AIDS. Hairyleukoplakia is a white area of diseased tissue on thetongue that may be flat or slightly raised. It is caused bythe Epstein-Barr virus.

Patients with late-stageAIDS may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma(KS), a skintumor that primarily affects homosexual men. KS is themost common AIDS-related malignancy. It is character-ized by reddish-purple blotches or patches (brownish inAfrican-Americans) on the skin or in the mouth. About40% of patients with KS develop symptoms in the diges-tive tract or lungs. KS may be caused by a herpes virus-like sexually transmitted disease agent rather than HIV .The second most common form of cancerin AIDS patients is a tumor of the lymphatic system (lymphoma).AIDS-related lymphomas often affect the central nervoussystem and develop very aggressively.KEY TERMS
Acute retroviral syndrome—A group of symptomsresembling mononucleosis that often are the firstsign of HIV infection in 50-70% of all patients and45-90% of women.AIDS dementia complex—A type of brain dysfunc-tion caused by HIV infection that causes difficultythinking, confusion, and loss of muscular coordi-nation.Antibody—A specific protein produced by theimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body toproduce antibody.Autoimmunity—A condition in which the body’simmune system produces antibodies in response toits own tissues or blood components instead of for-eign particles or microorganisms.CCR5—A chemokine receptor; defects in its struc-ture caused by genetic mutation cause the progres-sion of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood,sometimes called the T4 antigen, that is present onthe surface of 65% of immune cells. The HIV virusinfects cells with CD4 surface proteins, and as aresult, depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natur-al killer cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood.Most of the damage to an AIDS patient’s immunesystem is done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+lymphocytes.Chemokine receptor—A receptor on the surface ofsome types of immune cells that helps to mediateentry of HIV into the cell.Hairy leukoplakia of the tongue—A white area ofdiseased tissue on the tongue that may be flat orslightly raised. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virusand is an important diagnostic sign of AIDS.Hemophilia—Any of several hereditary blood coag-ulation disorders occurring almost exclusively inmales. Because blood does not clot properly, evenminor injuries can cause significant blood loss thatmay require a blood transfusion, with its associatedminor risk of infection.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis-sible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Twoforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and SouthAmerica, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, whichis chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-1 and may also have a longer latency period.Immunodeficient—A condition in which the body’simmune response is damaged, weakened, or is notfunctioning properly.Kaposi’s sarcoma—A cancer of the connective tis-sue that produces painless purplish red (in peoplewith light skin) or brown (in people with dark skin)blotches on the skin. It is a major diagnostic markerof AIDS.Latent period—Also called incubation period, thetime between infection with a disease-causingagent and the development of disease.Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that isimportant in the formation of antibodies and thatcan be used to monitor the health of AIDS patients.Invasive cancer of the cervix (related to certain typesof human papilloma virus [HPV]) is an important diag-nostic marker of AIDS in women.
Diagnosis
Because HIV infection produces such a wide rangeof symptoms, the CDC has drawn up a list of 34 condi-tions regarded as defining AIDS. The physician will usethe CDC list to decide whether the patient falls into oneof these three groups:• definitive diagnoses with or without laboratory evi-dence of HIV infection

BLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test forAIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients whoare being tested for HIV infection are usually given anenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for thepresence of HIV antibody in their blood. Positive ELISAresults are then tested with a Western blot or immunofluo-rescence (IFA) assay for confirmation. The combinationof the ELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9%
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 79AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 79accurate in detecting HIV infection within four to eightweeks following exposure. The polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) test can be used to detect the presence of viralnucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patientswho have false-negative results on the ELISA and West-ern blot tests. These tests are also used to detect virusesand bacterium other than HIV and AIDS.
OTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos-tic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used totrack the course of AIDS in patients that have alreadybeen diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral loadtests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of /H9252
2- microglobulin (/H9252
2M).Doctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose thepresence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis-ease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples ofcerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques,such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computed tomography scans(CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-relatedcancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the centralnervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stoolsamples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites.AIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilisand other sexually transmitted diseases.Diagnosis in childrenDiagnostic blood testing in children older than 18months is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screeningconfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag-nosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,and p24 antigen testing.In terms of symptoms, children are less likely thanadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev-er, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequentillness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,failure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Childrenwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-tions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related braindisorders than are HIV-positive adults.
Treatment
Treatment for AIDS covers four considerations:
TREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS ANDMALIGNANCIES.
Most AIDS patients require complexlong-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-eases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-opment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-related malignancies in the central nervous system areusually treated with radiation therapy. Cancers else-where in the body are treated with chemotherapy.PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTICINFECTIONS.
Prophylactic treatment is treatment that isgiven to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history ofPneumocystispneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200cells/mm
3or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrushshould be given prophylactic medications. The threedrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-sone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent yearsresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIVreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on thebody. These drugs fall into three classes:• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interferingwith the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-ed cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. Thesedrugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-dine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-dine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).•Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effectiveagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance tonucleoside analogues, and are often used in combinationwith them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-avir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This isa new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine andefavirin.Treatment guidelines for these agents are in constantchange as new medications are developed and intro-duced. Two principles currently guide doctors in workingout drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinationsof drugs rather than one medication alone; and basingtreatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viralload tests.
STIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.
Because many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-ly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they maybe given medications to stimulate blood cell production.Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemicpatients. Patients with low white blood cell counts maybe given filgrastim or sargramostim.Treatment in womenTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-larly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has beenshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped intotwo categories: those intended to help the immune sys-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 80AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80tem and those aimed at paincontrol. Treatments thatmay enhance the function of the immune system includeChinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine,macrobiotic and other special diets,guided imageryand creative visualization,homeopathy, and vitamin therapy.Pain control therapies include hydrotherapy,reiki, acupuncture,meditation,chiropractictreatments, andtherapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also beused to help with side effects of the medications used inthe treatment of AIDS.
Prognosis
At the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.Treatment stresses aggressive combination drugtherapy for those patients with access to the expensivemedications and who tolerate them adequately. The useof these multi-drug therapies has significantly reducedthe numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting fromAIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potentialexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using theseand other drug therapies to boost the immune system,keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-tic infections and malignancies.Prognosis after the latency period depends on thepatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systemsaffected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-phomas of the central nervous system die within two tothree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-phomas may survive for eight to ten months.
Prevention
As of 2001, there is no vaccine effective againstAIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,however, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as atherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing tofull-blown AIDS.In the meantime, there are many things that can bedone to prevent the spread of AIDS:• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individualsmust be instructed in the proper use of condoms andurged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk ofHIV infection, condoms are successful in preventingother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-nancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship withsomeone, get tested for HIV infection.• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-tored, those individuals who are planning to undergomajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of timeto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion.• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-cautions by wearing gloves and masks when handlingbody fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.• If you suspect that you may have become infected, gettested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively earlyon, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi-nitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital tolet your sexual partners know so that they can be testedand, if necessary, receive medical attention.ResourcesBOOKS

Definition
AIDStests, short for acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome tests, cover a number of different proceduresused in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.
Purpose
AIDS serology serves several different purposes.Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.In order to understand the different purposes of theblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways:• by sexual contact• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood andurine)• by transmission during pregnancy,o r• through transfusionof infected blood productsA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzymecalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, andmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cellsand B cells) in the human immune system to respond toinfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.
Precautions
In some states such as New York, a signed consentform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. Aswith all blood tests, healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins.
Description
Diagnostic testsDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given topersons in high-risk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons whohave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolatingthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—ittakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).
This type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test forHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well orbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-ond antibody.The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-sitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-risk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-tive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample ofthe patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is positive, theresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.
WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blotor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure toconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large proteinmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from oneanother by running an electric current through the gel).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 82AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon ornitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is reacted againstthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a coloredpatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot testfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricatedstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s bloodserum and the developing chemicals. About nine differentHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.When used in combination with ELISA testing,Western blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,yield false negatives in patients with very early HIVinfection and in those infected by HIV-2. In somepatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This methodis sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofWestern blotting. An IFA test detects the presence ofHIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-ing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding theblood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-scope with ultraviolet light.
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test isused to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patientswith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. Thesepatients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-matic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do nothave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectablequantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-tive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for thevery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted byblood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-sure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’sblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV .This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-ic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene aremade by separating the two strands of DNA containingthe gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-merase to make a copy, and then continuously replicatingthe copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replaceWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generatedan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelmingmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISAscreening within one to three months of infection. Inaddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge ofthe genetic sequences in HIV . Since the virus is continual-ly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield afalse negative in patients with these new variants.In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit containsmultiple components, including material for specimen col-lection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-ratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-seling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.The results are obtained by the purchaser through a tollfree telephone number using a personal identificationnumber (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over thetelephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approvedby the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.Prognostic testsBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosedwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostictests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-sons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longerbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patientsare sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomaticcarriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-uate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.
BLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure thenumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDSpatient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-ease is progressing, or whether certain treatments arehelping the patient. These cell count tests include:• Complete blood count(CBC). A CBC is a routine analy-sis performed on a sample of blood taken from thepatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The mea-

AlthoughCBCs are used on more than just AIDS patients, they canhelp the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has anadvanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related signsin a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp decrease in thenumber of blood platelets, and a low level of a certain typeof white blood cell called neutrophils.• Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a typeof white blood cell that is important in the formationKEY TERMS
Antibody—A protein in the blood that identifiesand helps remove disease organisms or their toxins.Antibodies are secreted by B cells. AIDS diagnostictests work by demonstrating the presence of HIVantibody in the patient’s blood.Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body toproduce antibodies.B cell—A type of white blood cell derived frombone marrow. B cells are sometimes called B lym-phocytes. They secrete antibody and have a numberof other complex functions within the humanimmune system.CD4—A type of protein molecule in human bloodthat is present on the surface of 65% of human Tcells. CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When theHIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, itdepletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killercells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most ofthe damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system isdone by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho-cytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.Complete blood count (CBC)—A routine analysisperformed on a sample of blood taken from thepatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. Themeasurements taken in a CBC include a white bloodcell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri-bution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume ofthe red blood cells to the blood volume), and theamount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car-ries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used formany medical reasons and are not used only forAIDS patients. They can help the doctor determine ifa patient is in advanced stages of the disease.Electrophoresis—A method of separating complexprotein molecules suspended in a gel by running anelectric current through the gel.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)—Adiagnostic blood test used to screen patients forAIDS or other viruses. The patient’s blood is mixedwith antigen attached to a plastic tube or bead sur-face. A sample of the patient’s blood serum isadded, and excess proteins are removed. A secondantibody coupled to an enzyme is added, followedby a chemical that will cause a color reaction thatcan be measured by a special instrument.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis-sible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Twoforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and SouthAmerica, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, whichis chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-1, but may also have a longer latency period.Immunofluorescent assay (IFA)—A blood testsometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofusing the Western blotting. In an IFA test, HIV anti-gen is mixed with a fluorescent compound and thenwith a sample of the patient’s blood. If HIV antibodyis present, the mixture will fluoresce when exam-ined under ultraviolet light.Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that isimportant in the formation of antibodies. Doctorsof an immune response. Because HIV targets CD4+lymphocytes, their number in the patient’s blood canbe used to track the course of the infection. This bloodcell count is considered the most accurate indicatorfor the presence of an opportunistic infection in anAIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte countis obtained by multiplying the patient’s white bloodcell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytesamong the white blood cells, and multiplying theresult by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing theCD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300CD+4 lymphocytes in 1 cubic millimeter (mm
3) of blood indicates that the patient is vulnerable to someopportunistic infections.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 84AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 84• CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think thatthis is a more accurate test than the absolute countbecause the percentage does not depend on a manualcalculation of the number of types of different whiteblood cells. A white blood cell count that is brokendown into categories in this way is called a WBC dif-ferential.It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients tomeasure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.Experts consulted by the United States Public HealthService recommend the following frequency of serumtesting based on the patient’s CD4+ level:• CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm
3: Every six months.KEY TERMS
can monitor the health of AIDS patients by measur-ing the number or proportion of certain types oflymphocytes in the patient’s blood.Macrophage—A large white blood cell, found pri-marily in the bloodstream and connective tissue,that helps the body fight off infections by ingestingthe disease organism. HIV can infect and killmacrophages.Monocyte—A large white blood cell that is formedin the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of thewhite blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.Opportunistic infection—An infection that devel-ops only when a person’s immune system is weak-ened, as happens to AIDS patients.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—A test performedto evaluate false-negative results to the ELISA andWestern blot tests. In PCR testing, numerous copiesof a gene are made by separating the two strands ofDNA containing the gene segment, marking itslocation, using DNA polymerase to make a copy,and then continuously replicating the copies. Theamplification of gene sequences that are associatedwith HIV allows for detection of the virus by thismethod.Retrovirus—A virus that contains a unique enzymecalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to repli-cate within new host cells.Seroconversion—The change from HIV- negative toHIV-positive status during blood testing. Personswho are HIV-positive are called seroconverters.Serology—The analysis of the contents and proper-ties of blood serum.Serum—The part of human blood that remains liq-uid when blood cells form a clot. Human bloodserum is clear light yellow in color.T cells—Lymphocytes that originate in the thymusgland. T cells regulate the immune system’sresponse to infections, including HIV. CD4 lympho-cytes are a subset of T lymphocytes.Viral load test—A new blood test for monitoring thespeed of HIV replication in AIDS patients. The viralload test is based on PCR techniques and supple-ments the CD4+ cell count tests.Western blot—A technique developed in 1979 thatis used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is puri-fied by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to anylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum isreacted against the filter, followed by treatment withdeveloping chemicals that allow HIV antibody toshow up as a colored patch or blot. If the patient isHIV-positive, there will be stripes at specific loca-tions for two or more viral proteins. A negativeresult is blank.WBC differential—A white blood cell count inwhich the technician classifies the different whiteblood cells by type as well as calculating the num-ber of each type. A WBC differential is necessary tocalculate the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count.• CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm
3: Every threemonths.• CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm
3: Every three months.When the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm
3, the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen toprotect him or her against opportunistic infections.
HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood testfor monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It sup-plements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor theextent of the patient’s loss of immune function, but notthe speed of HIV replication in the body. The viral loadtest is based on PCR techniques and can measure the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 85AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 85number of copies of HIV nucleic acids. Successive testresults for a given patient’s viral load are calculated on abase 10 logarithmic scale.
BETA2-MICROGLOBULIN ( /H92522M).Beta2-microglobulinis a protein found on the surface of all human cells witha nucleus. It is released into the blood when a cell dies.Although rising blood levels of /H9252
2M are found inpatients with cancerand other serious diseases, a rising/H9252
2M blood level can be used to measure the progressionof AIDS.
P24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viralcore of HIV , p24 is a protein that can be measured bythe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays tomeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-tions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful indetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-er, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of personsinfected with HIV .
GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypictesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-tions, common in people with HIV , are causing drugresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specificgenetic mutations of within the virus that are known tocause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.For example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that havea mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-scriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-tance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-ly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely torespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are onlyeffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-tion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies permilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usuallybetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered bymany insurance plans.
PHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno- typic testing directly measures the sensitivity of apatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.To do this, it measures the concentration of a drugrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. Thisis the same method used by researchers to determinewhether a drug might be effective against HIV beforeusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is amore direct measurement of resistance than genotypictesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-ing does not require a high viral load but it is recom-mended that persons already be taking antiretroviraldrugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is nowcovered by many insurance plans.AIDS serology in childrenChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquirethe infection through the mother’s placenta or during thebirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-ing and monitoring of all children born to mothers withHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 monthsis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-firmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosedby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24antigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician toidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.Preparation
Preparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDSdiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take thepatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-stances into account and to provide counseling before andafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope withthe results if the doctor has spent some time with thembefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIVinfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type ofinformational counseling before performing the tests.
Aftercare
If the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-itive, he or she will need counseling, information, referralfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel thepatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-selor to discuss the results of the blood tests with thepatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional andpsychological status, including the possibility of violentbehavior and the availability of a support network.
Risks
The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related todisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to anyphysical risks connected with blood testing. Somepatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-nosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,resources, belief system, and similar factors.
Normal results
Normal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, andPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.Normal results for blood cell counts:• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of thewhite blood cells.• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.

Alanine aminotransferase test
Definition
The alanine aminotransferase test, also known asALT, is one of a group of tests known as liver functiontests(or LFTs) and is used to monitor damage to the liver.
Purpose
ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities.Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also foundin muscle, tests indicating elevated AST levels might alsoindicate muscle damage. However, other tests, such as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 87Alanine aminotransferase testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 87the levels of the MB fraction of creatine kinase shouldindicate whether the abnormal test levels are because ofmuscle or liver damage.
Description
The alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can revealliver damage. It is probably the most specific test forliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damageis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since theamount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higherALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,ALT levels may experience serious liver damage withoutan increase in ALT.Nevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,because ALT levels are elevated in most patients withliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarilyindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they mayindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALTlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-tant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,within a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greaterfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers fromalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may begleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.
Preparation
No special preparations are necessary for this test.
Aftercare
This test involves blood being drawn, probably froma vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep thewound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-dage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report anyunusual symptoms to their physician.
Normal results
Normal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,and should be available to your physician at the time ofthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-cates many laboratories find values from approximatelyseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.
Abnormal results
Low levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) mayindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-ins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usuallyresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart attack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L thatresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of thebile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)may support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.It is important to note that persons with normal liv-ers may have slightly elevated levels of ALT. This is anormal finding.Michael V . Zuck, PhDAlanine aminotransferase test seeLiverfunction testsAlbers-Schönberg disease seeOsteopetroses
Albinism
Definition
Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth,characterized by a lack of pigment that normally givescolor to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of albinismexist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varyingdegrees. The condition, which is found in all races, maybe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skincancerlater in life.
Description
Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than fivepeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; forexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every100,000 people in southern Nigeria.There are 10 types of the most common form of thecondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” whichaffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. Peoplewith a less severe form are born with white hair andskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyonewith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormalflickering eye movements (nystagmus) and sensitivityto bright light. There may be other eye problems aswell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes(strabismus).The second most common type of the condition isknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lackcolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms ofocular albinism; some types cause more problems—especially eye problems—than others.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 88AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88Causes and symptoms
Every cell in the body contains a matched pair ofgenes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act as asort of “blueprint” that guides the development of a fetus.Albinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw inone or more of the genes that are responsible for direct-ing the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment). As aresult, little or no pigment is made, and the child’s skin,eyes and hair may be colorless.In most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the childinherits flawed genes for making melanin from both par-ents. Because the task of making melanin is complex,there are many different types of albinism, involving anumber of different genes.It’s also possible to inherit one normal gene and onealbinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene providesenough information in its cellular blueprint to makesome pigment, and the child will have normal skin andeye color. They “carry” one gene for albinism. About onein 70 people are albinism carriers, with one flawed genebut no symptoms; they have a 50% chance of passing thealbinism gene to their child. However, if both parents areKEY TERMS
Amino acids—Natural substances that are thebuilding blocks of protein. The body breaks downthe protein in food into amino acids, and then usesthese amino acids to create other proteins. The bodyalso changes amino acids into melanin pigment.Astigmatism—An eye condition in which the lensdoesn’t focus light evenly on the retina, leading toproblems with visual sharpness.Carrier—A person with one normal gene and onefaulty gene, who can pass on a condition to otherswithout actually having symptoms.DNA—The abbreviation for “deoxyribonucleicacid,” the primary carrier of genetic informationfound in the chromosomes of almost all organisms.The entwined double structure allows the chromo-somes to be copied exactly during cell division.DOPA—The common name for a natural chemical(3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) made by the bodyduring the process of making melanin.Enzyme—A protein that helps the body convert onechemical substance to another.Gene—The basic unit of genetic material carried ina particular place on a chromosome. Genes arepassed on from parents to child when the spermand egg unite during conception.Hairbulb—The root of a strand of hair from whichthe color develops.Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)—A rare typeof albinism characterized by a problem with bloodclotting and a buildup of waxy material in lungsand intestines.Melanin—Pigment made in the hair, skin and eyes.Nystagmus—An involuntary back-and-forth move-ment of the eyes that is often found in albinism.Strabismus—Crossed or “lazy” eyes, often found inalbinism.Tyrosine—A protein building block found in a widevariety of foods that is used by the body to makemelanin.Tyrosinase—An enzyme in a pigment cell whichhelps change tyrosine to DOPA during the processof making melanin.carriers with one flawed gene each, they have a 1 in 4chance of passing on both copies of the flawed gene tothe child, who will have albinism. (There is also a type ofocular albinism that is carried on the X chromosome andoccurs almost exclusively in males because they haveonly one X chromosome and, therefore, no other gene forthe trait to override the flawed one.)Symptoms of albinism can involve the skin, hair,and eyes. The skin, because it contains little pigment,appears very light, as does the hair.Although people with albinism may experience a vari-ety of eye problems, one of the myths about albinism is thatit causes people to have pink or red eyes. In fact, peoplewith albinism can have irises varying from light gray orblue to brown. (The iris is the colored portion of the eyethat controls the size of the pupil, the opening that lets lightinto the eye.) If people with albinism seem to have reddisheyes, it’s because light is being reflected from the back ofthe eye (retina) in much the same way as happens whenpeople are photographed with an electronic flash.People with albinism may have one or more of thefollowing eye problems:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 89AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 89• They may be very far-sighted or near-sighted, and mayhave other defects in the curvature of the lens of the eye(astigmatism) that cause images to appear unfocused.• They may have a constant, involuntary movement ofthe eyeball called nystagmus.• They may have problems in coordinating the eyes in fix-ing and tracking objects (strabismus), which may lead toan appearance of having “crossed eyes” at times. Stra-bismus may cause some problems with depth percep-tion, especially at close distances.• They may be very sensitive to light (photophobia)because their irises allow “stray” light to enter their eyes.It’s a common misconception that people with albinismshouldn’t go out on sunny days, but wearing sunglassescan make it possible to go outside quite comfortably.In addition to the characteristically light skin andeye problems, people with a rare form of albinism calledHermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) also have a greatertendency to have bleeding disorders, inflammation of thelarge bowel (colitis), lung (pulmonary) disease, and kid-ney (renal) problems.Diagnosis
It’s not always easy to diagnose the exact type ofalbinism a person has; there are two tests available thatcan identify only two types of the condition. Recently, ablood test has been developed that can identify carriersof the gene for some types of albinism; a similar test dur-ing amniocentesiscan diagnose some types of albinismin an unborn child. A chorionic villus samplingtest dur- ing the fifth week of pregnancymay also reveal sometypes of albinism.The specific type of albinism a person has can bedetermined by taking a good family history and examin-ing the patient and several close relatives.The “hairbulb pigmentation test” is used to identifycarriers by incubating a piece of the person’s hair in asolution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the bodyuses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means thehair is making melanin (a “positive” test); light hairmeans there is no melanin. This test is the source of thenames of two types of albinism: “ty-pos” and “ty-neg.”The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulbpigmentation test. It measures the rate at which hair con-

Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 90verts tyrosine into another chemical (DOPA), which isthen made into pigment. The hair converts tyrosine withthe help of a substance called “tyrosinase.” In some typesof albinism, tyrosinase doesn’t do its job, and melaninproduction breaks down.
Treatment
There is no treatment that can replace the lack ofmelanin that causes the symptoms of albinism. Doctorscan only treat, not cure, the eye problems that oftenaccompany the lack of skin color. Glasses are usuallyneeded and can be tinted to ease painfrom too muchsunlight. There is no cure for involuntary eye movements(nystagmus), and treatments for focusing problems(surgery or contact lenses) are not effective in all cases.Crossed eyes (strabismus) can be treated duringinfancy, using eye patches, surgery or medicine injec-tions. Treatment may improve the appearance of theeye, but it can do nothing to cure the underlying con-dition.Patients with albinism should avoid excessive expo-sure to the sun, especially between 10 
A.M. and 2 P.M.I f exposure can’t be avoided, they should use UV A-UVBsunblocks with an SPF of at least 20. Taking beta-carotene may help provide some skin color, although itdoesn’t protect against sun exposure.
Prognosis
In the United States, people with this conditioncan expect to have a normal lifespan. People withalbinism may experience some social problemsbecause of a lack of understanding on the part of oth-ers. When a member of a normally dark-skinned ethnicgroup has albinism, he or she may face some verycomplex social challenges.One of the greatest health hazards for people withalbinism is excessive exposure to sun without protec-tion, which could lead to skin cancer. Wearing opaqueclothes and sunscreen rated SPF 20, people withalbinism can safely work and play outdoors safely evenduring the summer.
Prevention
Genetic counselingis very important to prevent fur-ther occurrences of the condition.Resources

Alcohol-related neurologic disease
Definition
Alcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxiceffects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on whichnerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol canhave far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain,peripheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem-ory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso-ry deficits. These different effects can be grouped inthree main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acuteeffects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud-denly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related tolong-term or chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol-relatedneurologic disease includes Wernicke-Korsakoff dis-ease, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, alcoholicmyopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawalsyndrome with seizures and deliriumtremens, and fetal alcohol syndrome.
Description
Acute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-ness (intoxication) or even death, and chronic or long-term abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage tovirtually any level of the nervous system. Any given
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 91AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 91patient with long-term alcohol abuse may have no neu-rologic complications, a single alcohol-related disease,or multiple conditions, depending on the genes theyhave inherited, how well nourished they are, and otherenvironmental factors, such as exposure to other drugsor toxins.Neurologic complications of alcohol abuse may alsoresult from nutritional deficiency, because alcoholicstend to eat poorly and may become depleted of thiamineor other vitaminsimportant for nervous system function.Persons who are intoxicated are also at higher risk forhead injuryor for compression injuries of the peripheralnerves. Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especiallysodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon-tine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in whichnerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli-cating alcoholic cirrhosismay cause dementia, deliri- um, and movement disorder.
Causes and symptoms
When a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed byblood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidlythroughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crossesthe blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole-cules from escaping from the blood vessel to the braintissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at bloodethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL inpeople who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor, coma,o r even death from respiratory depression and low bloodpressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.Although alcohol is broken down by the liver, thetoxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely adirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdownproducts. The fatal dose varies widely because peoplewho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects ofalcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol toleranceresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol toachieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-hood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high andpotentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularlytrue when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting decreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes evenhigher blood alcohol levels.When a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,withdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increasedexcitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-um tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eighthours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72hours after abstinence. They include body shaking(tremulousness),insomnia, agitation, confusion, hear-ing voices or seeing images that are not really there(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-fuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol-related seizures may also occur without withdrawal,such as during active heavy drinking or after more than aweek without alcohol.Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-ciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen inpeople who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-amine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that preventsthe absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-tion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;the symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-orientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.Examination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,including jerking of the eyes (nystagmus) and doublevision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.People may have trouble coordinating their leg move-ments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not givenpromptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-por, coma, and death.If thiamine is given and death averted,Korsakoff’ssyndromemay develop in some patients, who sufferfrom memory impairment that leaves them unable toremember events for a period of a few years before theonset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to learnnew information (anterograde amnesia). Most patientshave very limited insight into their memory dysfunctionand have a tendency to make up explanations for eventsthey have forgotten (confabulation).Severe alcoholismcan cause cerebellar degenera-tion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions ofthe brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-mis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, andan inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. Thegait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, butmay be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenlyworsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born toalcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanolretards fetal growth and development. Affected infantsoften have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip,flat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size.Almost half are mentally retarded, and most others aremildly impaired intellectually or have problems withspeech, learning, and behavior.Alcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary tobreakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholicrhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males areaffected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathyfour times as often as females. Breakdown of muscle tis-sue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly during bingedrinking or in the first days of alcohol withdrawal. In itsmildest form, this breakdown may cause no noticeable
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 92Alcohol-related neurologic diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 92symptoms, but may be detected by a temporary elevationin blood levels of an enzyme found predominantly inmuscle, the MM fraction of creatine kinase.The severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy isassociated with the sudden onset of muscle pain, swelling, and weakness; a reddish tinge in the urinecaused by myoglobin, a breakdown product of muscleexcreted in the urine; and a rapid rise in muscle enzymesin the blood. Symptoms usually worsen over hours to afew days, and then improve over the next week to 10days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Musclesymptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swellingmay selectively involve the calves or other musclegroups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholicmyopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, whichmay occur when people drink so much that they com-press a muscle group with their body weight for a longtime without moving, or by withdrawal seizures withgeneralized muscle activity.In patients who abuse alcohol over many years,chronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males andfemales are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-less weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunkand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness developsgradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms ofacute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,may be striking. The nerves of the extremities may alsobegin to break down, a condition known as alcoholicperipheral neuropathy, which can add to the person’sdifficulty in moving.The way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue isstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms includemuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-cium, potassium, or other minerals; impaired muscleenergy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.Alcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by theliver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanolis converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletalmuscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver functionmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing theamount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-longed activity. Because not enough sugar is available tosupply needed energy, muscle protein may be brokendown as an alternate energy source. However, toxiceffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itselfrather than of its breakdown products.Although alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-tribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring themotor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholicneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning painin the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere withwalking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases butnumbness increases.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic diseasedepends largely on finding characteristic symptoms andsigns in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possiblecauses should be excluded by the appropriate tests,which may include blood chemistry,thyroid functiontests, brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinalfluid analysis.Acute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed byfinding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatinekinase and other blood enzymes released from injuredmuscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of musclefor microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows thescattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-tors must rule out other acquired causes of musclebreakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such asheroin,cocaine, or amphetamines; trauma with crushinjury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or anunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates orlipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatinekinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-phy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholicmyopathy or neuropathy.
Treatment
Acute management of alcohol intoxication, deliriumtremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-itor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failurethat may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat-ing may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondarylow blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben- zodiazepinessuch as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergicantagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago-nists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome israpidly reversible with thiamine, and because death mayintervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patientsadmitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well asall patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should begiven intravenous thiamine.Withdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe-cific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep-ticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption)should be treated vigorously. Acute alcoholic myopathywith myoglobinuria requires monitoring and mainte-nance of kidney function, and correction of imbalances
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 93Alcohol-related neurologic diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 93in blood chemistry including potassium, phosphate, andmagnesium levels.Chronic alcoholic myopathy and other chronic con-ditions are treated by correcting associated nutritionaldeficiencies and maintaining a diet adequate in proteinand carbohydrate. The key to treating any alcohol-relateddisease is helping the patient overcome alcohol addic- tion. Behavioral measures and social supports may beneeded in patients who develop broad problems in theirthinking abilities (dementia) or remain in a state of con-fusion and disorientation (delirium). People with walk-ing disturbances may benefit from physical therapy andassistive devices. Doctors may also prescribe drugs totreat the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy.
Prognosis
Complete recovery from Wernicke’s syndrome mayfollow prompt administration of thiamine. However,repeated episodes of encephalopathy or prolonged alco-hol abuse may cause persistent dementia or Korsakoffpsychosis. Most patients recover fully from acute alco-holic myopathy within days to weeks, but severe casesmay be fatal from acute kidney failureand disturbancesin heart rhythm secondary to increased potassium levels.Recovery from chronic alcoholic myopathy may occurKEY TERMS

Prevention
Prevention requires abstinence from alcohol. Per-sons who consume small or moderate amounts of alcoholmight theoretically help prevent nutritional complica-tions of alcohol use with dietary supplements includingB vitamins. However, proper nutritioncannot protectagainst the direct toxic effect of alcohol or of its break-down products. Patients with any alcohol-related symp-toms or conditions, pregnant women, and patients withliver or neurologic disease should abstain completely.Persons with family history of alcoholism or alcohol-related conditions may also be at increased risk for neu-rologic complications of alcohol use.Resources

Alcoholism
Definition
The essential feature of alcohol abuse is the mal-adaptive use of alcohol with recurrent and significantadverse consequences related to its repeated use. Alco-holism is the popular term for two disorders, alcoholabuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of boththese disorders involve repeated life problems that can bedirectly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-ders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-ual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impacton society at large.
Description
The effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.Alcohol affects every body system, causing a wide rangeof health problems. Some such problems include poornutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance andwalking, liver disease (including cirrhosisand hepatitis),high blood pressure, muscle weakness (including theheart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-ders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinalinflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problemswith the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-tent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-ened bones.On a personal level, alcoholism results in maritaland other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-ment,child abuse, and general family dysfunction.Alcoholism causes or contributes to a variety ofsevere social problems including homelessness, murder,suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-ing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-cle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur eachyear due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are dueto injuries of some sort. According to a recent specialreport prepared for the U.S. Congress by the NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impactof alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-dents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs our nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-tion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-dren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-hol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, ithas been estimated that approximately 18 percent ofadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-dence a some time during their lives.
Causes and symptoms
There are probably a number of factors that worktogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-atives of an alcoholic are four times more likely tobecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this riskholds true even for children who were adopted awayfrom their biological families at birth and raised in anon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge oftheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. Moreresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-tors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-lism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-ing an alcoholic.The symptoms of alcoholism can be broken downinto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcoholuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.Immediate (acute) effects of alcohol useAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. Theblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-ing the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quicklybecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’sdepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-ance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 95AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 95(accounting in part for the increased likelihood ofinjury). The affected person may also have impairment ofperiperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’sbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomitingmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathedinto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including thepossibility of pneumonia). Still higher alcohol levelsmay result in comaand death.Effects of long-term (chronic) alcoholismLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually everyorgan system of the body:• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men intheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholicblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantityof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the timesurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overallsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tinglingmay occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which canoccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’sand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the lowthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels foundin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficultywalking, while Korsakoff’s syndromeseverelyaffects one’s memory, preventing new learning fromtaking place.• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening ofthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contentsfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acidfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-gus, burning those tissues, and causing painand bleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also resultin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. Amajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development ofenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,which are called esophageal varices. These varices areactually developed in response to liver disease, andare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.Diarrheais a common symptom, due to alcohol’seffect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation ofthe pancreas (pancreatitis) is a serious and painfulproblem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ isseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-hol interferes with a number of important chemicalprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver beginsto enlarge and fill with fat (fatty liver), fibrous scartissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure andfunction (cirrhosis), and the liver may becomeinflamed (hepatitis).• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types ofblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormallylarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakenedimmune system. This places alcoholics at increasedrisk for infections, and is thought to account in partfor the increased risk of cancerfaced by alcoholics(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and bloodclotting factors are affected, causing an increased riskof bleeding.• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in bloodpressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins toincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. Highlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase therisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in anincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots formingwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatlyincreased risk of stroke(due to a blood clot from theheart entering the circulatory system, going to thebrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negativeeffect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-ing testicle and ovary size, and interfering with bothsperm and egg production. When pregnancyis achieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a greatrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which causes distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, andbehavioral problems.
Diagnosis
Two different types of alcohol-related difficultieshave been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-dence, which refers to a person who literally depends onthe use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must bepresent to diagnose alcohol dependence:• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomedto a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase thedose in order to obtain the desired effect• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiencesunpleasant physical and psychological symptoms whenhe or she does not drink alcohol• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-ficult to stop)• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking oncestarted
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 96AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96• having large blocks of time taken up by alcohol use• choosing to drink at the expense of other importanttasks or activities• drinking despite evidence of negative effects on one’shealth, relationships, education, or jobAlcohol abuserequires that one of the following fourcriteria is met. Because of drinking, a person repeatedly:• fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili-ties• physically endangers him or herself, or others (forexample, by drinking when driving)• gets into trouble with the law• experiences difficulties in relationships or jobsDiagnosis is sometimes brought about when familymembers call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attentionof a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspiciouswhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins toexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of aphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-logical assessments that try to determine what aspects ofa person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-son drinks is of much less importance than determininghow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing eitheralcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis ofalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consistsof four questions, with the first letters of each key wordspelling out the word CAGE:• Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking?• Have you ever been Annoyedby anyone’s commentsabout your drinking?• Have you ever felt Guiltyabout your drinking?• Do you ever need an Eye-opener(a morning drink ofalcohol) to start the day)?Other, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-mine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basisfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whetheranyone else in the person’s family has ever sufferedfrom alcoholism.Physical examinationmay reveal signs suggestiveof alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible networkof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen ( ascites); yellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size inmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal anincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalitiesin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fightinginfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.
Treatment
Treatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first stepin the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification, involves helping the person stop drinking and ridding hisor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.Because the person’s body has become accustomed toalcohol, the person will need to be supported throughwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for differentpatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, asmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and thelength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness,anxiety, and trem-bling. This phase is usually over in about three to fivedays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu- cinations(in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-thing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearablecraving for more alcohol, confusion,fever, fast heart rate,high blood pressure, and delirium(a fluctuating level ofconsciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severesymptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens)are those with other medical problems, including malnu- trition, liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome. Delirium

No medications are necessary,however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severeeffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and toavoid the potentially life-threatening complications of highblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs calledbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients sufferingfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluidsmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), alongwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usuallyquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamineis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.After cessation of drinking has been accomplished,the next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred toas rehabilitation. The best programs incorporate thefamily into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.Some therapists believe that family members, in an effortto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation isreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed inorder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholicsmeet regularly and provide support for each other’srecoveries, are considered some of the best methods ofpreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps themost well-known such group is called AlcoholicsAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing thedestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways inwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-ble, making amends to those people. According to arecent study reported by the American PsychologicalAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or herreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefitfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groupsexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-sionals combined.There are also medications that may help an alco-holic avoid returning to drinking. These have been usedwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drugwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-tions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of thesemedications would be helpful unless the patient was alsowilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for thealcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawalhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. These include massage,meditation, and hypnotherapy. The malnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitaminsA, B complex, and C, as well as certain fattyacids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbaltreatments include milk thistle(Silybum marianum), which is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbsare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering throughwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandulaofficinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile(Matricaria recutita), peppermint (Mentha piperita) yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and valerian (Valeriana officinalis). Acupunctureis believed to both decreasewithdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’schances for continued recovery from alcoholism.
Prognosis
Recovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. Infact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because mostresearchers in the field believe that since the potential foralcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological andpsychological makeup, one can never fully recover fromalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics instable financial and family situations who have undergonetreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt tostop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.
Prevention
Prevention must begin at a relatively young agesince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-

It is particularlyimportant that teenagers who are at high risk for alco-holism—those with a family history of alcoholism, anearly or frequent use of alcohol, a tendency to drink todrunkenness, alcohol use that interferes with schoolwork, a poor family environment, or a history of domes-tic violence—receive education about alcohol and itslong-term effects. How this is best achieved, without irri-tating the youngsters and thus losing their attention, isthe subject of continuing debate and study.Resources

Aldolase test
Definition
Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the body,particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is needed totrigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus-cle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done todiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.
Purpose
Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase levelfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are thosemuscles attached to bones and whose contractions makethose bones move. When the muscles are diseased ordamaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the cells dete-riorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-ing aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring theamount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree ofmuscle damage.As muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levelsdecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less musclemeans fewer cells and less aldolase.Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic aswell as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolaselevels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will benormal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi-cal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis, but aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of musculardisease, such as muscular dystrophy.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 99AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 99KEY TERMS
Aldolase—An enzyme, found primarily in themuscle, that helps convert sugar into energy.Enzyme—A substance needed to trigger specificchemical reactions.Neurologic—Having to do with the nervous sys-tem.Skeletal muscle—Muscle connected to, and nec-essary for the movement of, bones.Aldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac mus-cle of the heart. Damage or disease to these organs, suchas chronic hepatitis or a heart attack, will also increasealdolase levels in the blood, but to a lesser degree.
Description
Aldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serumwith a substance with which aldolase is known to triggera reaction. The end product of this reaction is measured,and, from that measurement, the amount of aldolase inthe person’s serum is determined.The test is covered by insurance when medicallynecessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml of blood needed for this test, ahealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.The patient should avoid strenuous exerciseand have nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to tenhours before this test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure tothe puncture site until the bleeding stops will reducebruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relievediscomfort.
Normal results
Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levelsand adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based onthe laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
As noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle dis-eases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s muscu-lar dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystro-phy, will increase the aldolase level more than any otherdisease.Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle, suchas injury,gangrene, or an infection, can also increase thealdolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarilyincrease a person’s aldolase level.Certain medications can increase the aldolase level,while others can decrease it. To interpret what the resultsof the aldolase test mean, a physician will evaluate theresult, the person’s clinical symptoms, and other teststhat are more specific for muscle damage and disease.ResourcesBOOKS

Aldosterone assay
Definition
This test measures the levels of aldosterone, a hor-mone produced by the outer part (cortex) of the twoadrenal glands, organs which sit one on top of each ofthe kidneys. Aldosterone regulates the amounts of sodi-um and potassium in the blood. This helps maintainwater balance and blood volume, which, in turn, affectsblood pressure.
Purpose
Aldosterone measurement is useful in detecting acondition called aldosteronism, which is caused byexcess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal glands.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 100Aldosterone assayGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 100There are two types of aldosteronism: primary and sec-ondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly causedby an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s syndrome. Idiopathic(of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronismis another typeof primary aldosteronism. Secondary aldosteronism ismore common and may occur with congestive heart fail-ure,cirrhosiswith fluid in the abdominal cavity(ascites), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,sodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy.To differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-ondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-formed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondaryaldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.
Description
Aldosterone testing can be performed on a bloodsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,including diet, posture (upright or lying down), and timeof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosteronelevels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-term fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over anentire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-fering factors and provides a more reliable aldosteronemeasurement.
Preparation
Fastingis not required for either the blood sampleor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-mal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for atleast two weeks before either test. The doctor shoulddecide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluidbalance (e.g.,diuretics, antihypertensives, steroids,oral contraceptives) should be withheld. The test will bemore accurate if these are suspended at least two weeksbefore the test. Renin inhibitors (e.g., propranolol)should not be taken one week before the test, unless per-mitted by the physician. The patient should avoid licoricefor at least two weeks before the test, because of itsaldosterone-like effect. Strenuous exerciseand stress can increase aldosterone levels as well. Because the testis usually performed by a method called radioimmunoas-say, recently administered radioactive medications willaffect test results.Since posture and body position affect aldosterone,hospitalized patients should remain in an upright position(at least sitting) for two hours before blood is drawn.Occasionally blood will be drawn again before thepatient gets out of bed. Nonhospitalized patients shouldarrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an uprightposition for at least two hours.Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may includeslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal results are laboratory-specific and also varywith sodium intake, with time of day, source of specimen(e.g., peripheral vein, adrenal vein, 24-hour urine), age,sex, and posture.Reference ranges for blood include:• supine (lying down): 3-10 ng/dL• upright (sitting for at least two hours): Female: 5-30ng/dL; Male: 6-22 ng/dLReference ranges for urine: 2-80 mg/24 hr.
Abnormal results
Increased levels of aldosterone are found in Conn’sdisease (aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor), and incases of Bartter’s syndrome (a condition in which thekidneys overexcrete potassium, sodium and chloride,resulting in low blood levels of potassium and high bloodlevels of aldosterone and renin). Among other condi-tions, elevated levels are also seen in secondary aldos-teronism, stress, and malignant hypertension.Decreased levels of aldosterone are found in aldos-terone deficiency, steroid therapy, high-sodium diets, certain antihypertensive therapies, and Addison’s dis-ease(an autoimmune disorder).Resources

Definition
Alemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the UnitedStates. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-body that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found onthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that isused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cellsof patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocyticleukemia (B-CLL).
Purpose
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treatB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronicleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found onthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immunesystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant Bcells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-tion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-body-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that theimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.Alemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA fortreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease tobe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-darabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,this drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-ments for B-CLL another option. As most patients withB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylatingagents and fludarabine have been tried, the experiencewith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with thosestages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% ofpatients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% ofthese being complete responses.This antibody has been tested with limited successin the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) andfor the preparation of patients with various immune cellmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There isalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-body to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.
Description
Alemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory usinggenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like allantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-ular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein foundon the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells aswell as other cells of the immune and male reproductivesystems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips ofthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but therest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence ofthe human sequences helps to reduce the immuneresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, aproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are usedfor cancer therapies. The human sequences also help toensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms ofthe human immune system are properly triggered withbinding of the antibody.Alemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for thetreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for usealone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-body to be used in combination with the purine analogspentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, amonoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,another protein found on the surface of B cells.
Recommended dosage
This antibody should be administered in a graduallyescalating pattern at the start of treatment and any timeadministration is interrupted for seven or more days. Therecommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is adaily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the doseis increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days aweek. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-choride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-sion to help reduce side effects.Additionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-tive medication before treatment to help minimize theserious opportunistic infections that can result from thistreatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-vent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial todecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.
Precautions
Blood studies should be done on a weekly basiswhile patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-ment. Vaccination during the treatment session is notrecommended, given the T cell depletion that occursduring treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodieslike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to thedeveloping fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-nancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unlessclearly needed.
Side effects
A severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is thepossible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 102AlemtuzumabGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102Because CD52 is expressed on a patient’s normal B andT cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal B cells,the treatment eliminates both normal and cancerouscells. The treatment also seems to trigger autoimmunereactions against various other blood cells. This results insevere reduction of the many circulating blood cellsincluding red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells(neutropenia), and clotting cells (thrombopenia). Theseconditions are treated with blood transfusions. The greatmajority of patients treated exhibit some type of bloodcell depletion.A second serious side effect of this drug is the preva-lence of opportunistic infections that occurs during thetreatment. Serious, and sometimes fatal bacterial, viral,fungal, and protozoan infections have been reported.Treatments to prevent pneumonia and herpes infectionsreduce, but do not eliminate these infections.The majority of other side effects occur after or dur-ing the first infusion of the drug. Some common sideeffects of this drug include fever and chills, nausea andvomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, skin rash, andunusual fatigue. This drug can also cause low blood pres-sure (hypotension).KEY TERMS

Thought to bedue to the release of the lysed cells’ contents into theblood stream, it can cause a misbalance of urea, uricacid, phosphate, potassium, and calcium in the urine andblood. Patients at risk for this side effect must keephydrated and can be given allopurinol before infusion.

Alexander technique
Definition
The Alexander technique is a somatic method forimproving physical and mental functioning. Excessivetension, which Frederick Alexander, the originator, rec-ognized as both physical and mental, restricts movementand creates pressure in the joints, the spine, the breathingmechanism, and other organs. The goal of the techniqueis to restore freedom and expression to the body andclear thinking to the mind.
Purpose
Because the Alexander technique helps studentsimprove overall functioning, both mental and physical, itoffers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements insuch diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing,depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness,resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skillof playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote alist of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech-nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis,then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth- ma; following in their wake, circulation defects, whichmay lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger-ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of manytypes, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures,migraines and depressive states.”Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to includeimprovements in back pain, chronic pain, postural prob-

Description
OriginsFrederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 inTasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake-spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to sufferfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with arecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,his problem persisted.Alexander realized that his hoarseness began aboutan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that itwas something he did in the process of reciting thatcaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medicaldoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When thedoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander wasdoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to tryand find out for himself.Thus began a decade of self-observation and discov-ery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself inthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve hiscoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-ed speech or movement. After making this discovery atthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became apioneer in body-mind medicine.At first, performers and dancers sought guidancefrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints andto improve the expression and spontaneity of theirperformances. Soon a great number of people soughthelp from his teaching for a variety of physical andmental disorders.The Alexander technique is primarily taught one-on-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops orworkshops for special applications of the technique(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,and are taught in a series. The number of lessons variesaccording to the severity of the student’s difficultieswith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-tinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 perhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, butdiscounts are available for participants in some comple-mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible SpendingAccounts for health care cover Alexander techniquelessons if they are prescribed by a physician.In lessons teachers guide students through simplemovements (while students are dressed in comfortableclothing) and use their hands to help students identifyand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arisesfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussionsof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in thecourse of a lesson.The technique helps students move with ease andimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-ment (the lessons are a series of movements), mostpeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulderstoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tightentheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension intheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse ofthe body.At any point in a movement, proper use can beestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simplybecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out ofbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series ofstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It isskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity inthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathingmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons inthe technique aim to develop.Alexander found that optimal functioning of thebody was very hard to maintain, even for the short periodof time it took to complete a single movement. People,especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles iscommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-visions or video monitors, too much sitting or drivingand too little walking, or by tension associated with pasttraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after awhiplashinjury or favoring a broken or sprained leglong after it has healed are examples of habitual tensioncaused by injury.The first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-nique does is to increase a student’s sensory awarenessof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that inthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibitthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, forexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit andinstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 104Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitualresponse to sitting.By leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur-al free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, notheld in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release,the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen,a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity andbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.
Precautions
Side effectsThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide studentsin movement. Therefore, both contraindications andpotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the caseof errors in teaching, is unlikely.As students’ sensory awareness develops in thecourse of Alexander lessons, they become more acutelyaware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn torelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustainthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is causedby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened andreleased muscles and the expanded range of movementin the joints.Occasionally students may get light-headed during alesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-latory or respiratory functioning.Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid posturesoften indicate suppression of emotion. As musclesrelease during or after an Alexander lesson, students mayexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changesin mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface,bringing to consciousness past injury or trauma. This cancause extreme anxiety, and referrals may be made by theteacher for counseling.
Research and general acceptance
Alexander became well known among the intellectu-al, artistic, and medical communities in London, Eng-land, during the first half of the twentieth century.Among Alexander’s supporters were John Dewey,Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw, and renowned scientistsRaymond Dart, G.E. Coghill, Charles Sherrington, andNikolaas Tinbergen.Researchers continue to study the effects and appli-cations of the technique in the fields of education, pre-KEY TERMS

Alkaline phosphatase test
Definition
Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found through-out the body. Like all enzymes, it is needed, in smallamounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When itis present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liverdisease or a tumor.
Purpose
Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concernedwith the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkalinephosphate and other substances is continually drainedaway through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bileduct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventuallyescapes into the bloodstream.The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced bythe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.Its origin differs from that of other enzymes calledaminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of anobstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliarydrainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be thefirst and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the otherhand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-cytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,these enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the typeof liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.Growing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-dition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphataselevels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as achildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;or the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer, Paget’s disease, or rickets.During pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made bythe placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.This is normal. Some tumors, however, start productionof the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by theplacenta. These tumors are called germ cell tumors andinclude testicular cancerand certain brain tumors.Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increasedin a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such asulcerative colitis.
Description
Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining theperson’s serum with specific substances with which alka-line phosphatase is known to react. The end product ofthis reaction is measured; and from that measurement,the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serumis determined.Each tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. Thesevariations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-line phosphatase is measured as the total amount or theamount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-zymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, andother processes in the laboratory. Methods to measurethem separately are based on these differences.The test is covered by insurance when medicallynecessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, ahealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.A person being tested for alkaline phosphataseshouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, foreight to ten hours before the test. Some people releasealkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the blood-stream after eating. This will temporarily increase theresult of the test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture siteor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 106Alkaline phosphatase testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 106puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary by age and by sex. They alsovary based on the laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
Bone and liver disease increase alkaline phosphatasemore than any other disease, up to five times the normallevel. Irritable bowel disease, germ cell tumors, andinfections involving the liver, such as viral hepatitis andinfectious mononucleosis, increase the enzyme also, butto a lesser degree. Healing bones, pregnancy, and normalgrowth in children also increase levels.Resources

Allergic bronchopulmonaryaspergillosis
Definition
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or ABPA,is one of four major types of infections in humans causedby Aspergillusfungi. ABPA is a hypersensitivity reactionthat occurs in asthmapatients who are allergic to thisspecific fungus.
Description
ABPA is an allergic reaction to a species ofAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimesgrouped together with other lung disorders characterizedby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain typeof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading ofeosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also calledhypersensitivity lung diseases.ABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in theUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are notclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-ics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.
Causes and symptoms
ABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-taining Aspergillusspores. These spores are foundworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,forests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.They are also found on wet paint, construction materials,and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomialinfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-pital. When Aspergillusspores reach the bronchi, whichare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So thepatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes orcoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-gradefeverand lose their appetites.ComplicationsPatients with ABPA sometimes coughup large amounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis. They may also develop a serious long-term form ofbronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in thelungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 107Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, andmarked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage to,the bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-plication of cystic fibrosis.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination ofthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputumtests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor willbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-ening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or otherlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:• a history of asthma.• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on achest x ray.• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, ordestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).• skin reaction to Aspergillusantigen.• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.•Aspergillusprecipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-itins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form asolid that separates from the rest of the solution in thetest tube.• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to aclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergicreactions to foreign particles.Other criteria that may be used to support the diag-nosis include the presence of Aspergillusin samples ofthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brownmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillusantigen.Laboratory testsThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain thisinformation include a complete blood count(CBC), a sputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, anda skin test for the Aspergillusantigen. In the skin test, asmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layerof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inchesbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgEantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what iscalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-utes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized bythe eruption of a reddened,itchingspot on the skin.Some patients with ABPA will develop the so-calledlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,swollen area develops about six to eight hours after theinitial reaction.Aspergilluscan sometimes be seen under a micro-scope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-nosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-tured in the laboratory. Aspergillusis easy to culture, andcan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)preparations.Diagnostic imagingChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for thepresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs ofbronchiectasis.
Treatment
ABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-corten) or other corticosteroidstaken by mouth, andwith bronchodilators.Antifungal drugs are notused to treat ABPA becauseit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather than by direct infection of tissue.Follow-up carePatients with ABPA should be given periodiccheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. Aspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’slung capacity.
Prognosis
Most patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-teroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-ual improvement over time. The best indicator of a goodprognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.Patients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-op severe airway obstruction.
Prevention
ABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillusis a common fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputumof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-tect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-post piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet orrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites ornewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-tioners cleaned regularly. Some patients may be helpedby air filtration systems for their bedrooms or offices.Resources

Allergic purpura
Definition
Allergic purpura (AP) is an allergic reaction ofunknown origin causing red patches on the skin and othersymptoms. AP is also called Henoch-Schonlein purpura,named after the two doctors who first described it.
Description
“Purpura” is a bleeding disorder that occurs whencapillaries rupture, allowing small amounts of blood toaccumulate in the surrounding tissues. In AP, this occursbecause the capillaries are blocked by protein complexes
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 109Allergic purpuraGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 109KEY TERMS
Glomeruli—Knots of capillaries in the kidneysresponsible for filtering the blood (singular,glomerulus).formed during an abnormal immune reaction. The skin isthe most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-testinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.AP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-ed States each year. Most cases are children between theages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often thangirls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.
Causes and symptoms
CausesAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-cial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies aredesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes canbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-stream. When this occurs, they precipitate out andbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-illary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.The source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.Antigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-tion. More than 75% of patients report having had aninfection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-trointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.Other complex molecules can act as antigens as well,including drugs such as antibioticsor vaccines. Other-wise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-tion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that maycause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP includethose for typhoid,measles,cholera, and yellow fever. SymptomsThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache, fever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop anitchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, andmay be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-er, resembling a bruise. Rashesbecome purple and thenrust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-eral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on thebody may also occur, especially in younger children.Joint painand swelling is common, especially inthe knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almostall patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).About half of all patients show blood in the urine, lowurine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstructionof the capillaries in the filtering structures calledglomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of allpatients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-tein in the urine.Less common symptoms include prolonged head-ache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-ment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas(pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and theirdevelopment, a careful medical history, and blood andurine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans(CT) may be performed to assess complications in the bowelor other internal organs.
Treatment
Most cases of AP resolve completely without treat-ment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because ofthe possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin painrelievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids(like prednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-ists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requiresmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.Patients with severe kidney complications mayrequire a kidney biopsyso that tissue can be analyzed.Even after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels ofblood or protein in the urine may persist for months andrequire regular monitoring. Hypertensionor kidney fail-ure may develop months or even years after the acutephase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis ortransplantation.Plasmapheresis, which removes antibodies fromthe blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.
Prognosis
Most people who develop AP become better on theirown after several weeks. About half of all patients haveat least one recurrence. Cases that do not have kidneycomplications usually have the best prognosis.Resources

Allergic rhinitis
Definition
Allergic rhinitis, more commonly referred to as hayfever, is an inflammation of the nasal passages caused byallergic reaction to airborne substances.
Description
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergiccondition and one of the most common of all minorafflictions. It affects between 10-20% of all people inthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-tor visits. Antihistaminesand other drugs used to treatallergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of bothprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.There are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal andperennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at theirhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause ofsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all yearand is usually caused by home or workplace airbornepollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst afterspending time indoors.Both types of allergiescan develop at any age,although onset in childhood through early adulthood ismost common. Although allergy to a particular substanceis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run inthe family.” While allergies can improve on their ownover time, they can also become worse over time.
Causes and symptoms
CausesAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigensets off a series of reactions designed to protect the bodyfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactionsis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is thecondition known as allergy, and the offending substanceis called an allergen.Like all allergic reactions, AR involves a specialset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passagesand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, calledimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spillout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, includingblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,through special proteins called histamine receptors.Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leadingto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased rednesscharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, causing theitchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-gic rhinitis.The number of possible airborne allergens is enor-mous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grassand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in largeamounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a stickypollen which is less likely to become airborne. Differentplants release their pollen at different times of the year,so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke aresponse. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected inthe pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after agood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higheron warm, dry, windy days.Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. Afew types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble forpeople include the following:• ragweed• sagebrush• lamb’s-quarters• plantain• pigweed• dock/sorrel

House dust contains some orall of the following:• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-bers of microscopic insects called house mites. Theseharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed bythe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-ly become airborne.• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,and dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred frompet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergyin many sensitive people.• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout thehouse, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, airconditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,mattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and othermolds release airborne spores which circulate through-out the house.Other potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitisinclude the following:• cigarette smoke• perfume• cosmetics• cleansers• copier chemicals• industrial chemicals• construction material gasesSymptomsInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the majorsymptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching, sneezing,runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling canconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner earto the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-ping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the backof the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, canalso lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually alsocauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigueand headacheare also common.Diagnosis
Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and canoften be done without a medical specialist. When symp-toms appear in spring or summer and disappear with theonset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainlythe culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,can usually be ruled out by a physical examinationand a nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on aswab for examination.Allergy tests, including skin testing and provoca-tion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, butmay not be done unless a single source is suspected andsubsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involvesplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specificallergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,or injecting it into the skin surface to observe whetherredness and swelling occurs. Provocation testinginvolves challenging an individual with either a smallamount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if aresponse is elicited.Perennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-ful questioning about the timing of exposure and theonset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identifiedthrough allergy skin testing.

Avoidance of the allergens is the best treatment, butthis is often not possible. When it is not possible to avoidone or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-ical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.Drugs
ANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-mine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect ofhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used aftersymptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-tive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. Awide variety of antihistamines are available.Older antihistamines often produce drowsiness as amajor side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-lowing:• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)• clemastine (Tavist and generics).Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsinessare available by prescription and include the following:• astemizole (Hismanal)• loratidine (Claritin)• fexofenadine (Allegra)• azelastin HCl (Astelin).Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heartarrhythmiaswhen taken with the antibiotic ery-thromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.
DECONGESTANTS. Decongestantsconstrict bloodvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal liningand oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestantsare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and bloodpressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-tants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-ness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passagesbecome more severely swollen than before treatment.
TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos- teroidsreduce mucous membrane inflammation and areavailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worseas the season progresses because the immune systembecomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-duce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroidsare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-zation because they work more slowly and last longerthan most other medication types. As a result, they arebest started before allergy season begins. Side effects areusually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,and unpleasant taste sensations.MAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium preventsthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventingrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained inthem. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-al weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can beused for perennial AR as well.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization orallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in thebody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergicreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testingto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injectionsinvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts ofallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodicboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years toachieve and are not seen at all in about one in fivepatients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitoredclosely following each shot because of the small risk ofanaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficultybreathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AR often focus on modu-lation of the body’s immune response, and frequentlycenter around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chineseherbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, ascan both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment.Vitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize themucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west-ern herbal remedies including eyebright (Euphrasiaofficinalis) and nettle (Urtica dioica) may be helpful.Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi-nating AR symptoms.
Prognosis
Most people with AR can achieve adequate reliefwith a combination of preventive strategies and treat-ment. While allergies may improve over time, they mayalso get worse or expand to include new allergens. Earlytreatment can help prevent an increased sensitization toother allergens.

Reducing exposure to pollen may improve symp-toms of seasonal AR. Strategies include the following:• stay indoors with windows closed during the morninghours, when pollen levels are highest• keep car windows up while driving• use a surgical face mask when outside• avoid uncut fields• learn which trees are producing pollen in which sea-sons, and avoid forests at the height of pollen season• wash clothes and hair after being outside• clean air conditioner filters in the home regularly• use electrostatic filters for central air conditioningMoving to a region with lower pollen levels is rarelyeffective, since new allergies often developPreventing perennial AR requires identification ofthe responsible allergensMold spores:KEY TERMS
Allergen—A substance that provokes an allergicresponse.Anaphylaxis—Increased sensitivity caused by pre-vious exposure to an allergen that can result inblood vessel dilation (swelling) and smooth mus-cle contraction. Anaphylaxis can result in sharpblood pressure drops and difficulty breathing.Antibody—A specific protein produced by theimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.Antigen—A foreign protein to which the bodyreacts by making antibodies.Granules—Small packets of reactive chemicalsstored within cells.Histamine—A chemical released by mast cellsthat activates pain receptors and causes cells tobecome leaky.Mast cells—A type of immune system cell that isfound in the lining of the nasal passages and eye-lids, displays a type of antibody called immuno-globulin type E (IgE) on its cell surface, and partici-pates in the allergic response by releasing hista-mine from intracellular granules.• keep the house dry through ventilation and use of dehu-midifiers• use a disinfectant such as dilute bleach to clean surfacessuch as bathroom floors and walls• have ducts cleaned and disinfected• clean and disinfect air conditioners and coolers• throw out moldy or mildewed books, shoes, pillows, orfurnitureHouse dust:• vacuum frequently, and change the bag regularly.

Allergies
Definition
Allergies are abnormal reactions of the immune sys-tem that occur in response to otherwise harmless sub-stances.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 114AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 114Description
Allergies are among the most common of medicaldisorders. It is estimated that 60 million Americans, ormore than one in every five people, suffer from someform of allergy, with similar proportions throughoutmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largestreason for school absence and is a major source of lostproductivity in the workplace.An allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,the immune system responds to foreign microorganismsor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-bodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-tifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off aseries of chemical reactions designed to protect thebody from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substancessuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When thisoccurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-stance (an allergen.)Mast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-tions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-gens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packetscalled granules. Granules contain a variety of potentchemicals, including histamine.Immunologists separate allergic reactions into twomain types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, whichare predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur withinminutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-sitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of whiteblood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.Inhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-ate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-bodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-tents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-ing blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to thesurfaces of these other cells through special proteinscalled histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine withreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,leading to the fluid collection, swelling and increasedredness. Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, mak-ing tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms lastfrom one to several hours following contact.In the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-sitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-shot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointesti-nal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation ofthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping anddiarrheatypical of food allergy. Allergens that enter thecirculation may cause hives, angioedema,anaphylaxis, or atopic dermatitis.Allergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-sensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,setting in motion a more prolonged immune response.This type of allergic response may develop over severaldays following contact with the allergen, and symptomsmay persist for a week or more.
Causes and symptoms
Allergens enter the body through four main routes:the airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and thecirculatory system.• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,and itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever(allergic rhini- tis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of thelungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes,causing conjunctivitis(pink eye). Exposure to cock-roach allergans have been associated with the devel-opment of asthma. Airborne allergans from householdpets are another common source of environmentalexposure.• Allergens in food can cause itchingand swelling of thelips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbedinto the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)or more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-inflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergensmay cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threateningcondition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-tion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods suchcow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts andsoybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-bles may also occur.• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-ing, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis. Skin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-duced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis. Dermatitis may arise from an allergic response (suchas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causingnonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,and chemical agents).• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stingsor drug administration, can introduce allergens directlyinto the circulation, where they may cause system-wideresponses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the localones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.People with allergies are not equally sensitive toall allergens. Some may have severe allergic rhinitisbut no food allergies, for instance, or be extremely sen-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 115AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 115sitive to nuts but not to any other food. Allergies mayget worse over time. For example, childhood ragweedallergy may progress to year-round dust and pollenallergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergicsensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-pears in almost all people. More commonly, whatseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reducedexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for thesame level of symptoms.While allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,the likelihood of developing some type of allergy seemsto be, at least for many people. If neither parent hasallergies, the chances of a child developing allergy isapproximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.Onesource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability toproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.Those who produce more IgE will develop a strongerallergic sensitivity.
COMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborneallergens are the following:• plant pollens• animal fur and dander• body parts from house mites (microscopic creaturesfound in all houses)• house dust• mold spores• cigarette smoke• solvents• cleanersCommon food allergens include the following:• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts• fish, mollusks, and shellfish• eggs• wheat• milk• food additives and preservativesThe following types of drugs commonly cause aller-gic reactions:• penicillin or other antibiotics• flu vaccines• tetanus toxoid vaccine• gamma globulinCommon causes of contact dermatitis include thefollowing:• poison ivy, oak, and sumac• nickel or nickel alloys• latexInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stingstypically cause allergy include the following:• bees, wasps, and hornets• mosquitoes• fleas• scabiesSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergicreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat dueto post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membranecovering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-es wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symp- toms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-tive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-temically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinalsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,tongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; andgas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,weepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. Itsometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such asa glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,wrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-lobes by wearing earrings.Whole body or systemic reactions may occur fromany type of allergen, but are more common followingingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactionsinclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches calledhives that characteristically blanch with pressure andresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and moreextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluidcollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usuallyoccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of thehead,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airwayconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissueswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include, dizzi- ness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-ing. The symptoms may begin within five minutes afterexposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later.Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the bloodrelease mediators that give rise to the clinical symptomsof this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Common-ly, this is associated with allergies to medications, foods,and insect venoms. In some individuals, anaphylaxis canoccur with exercise, plasma exchange, hemodialysis,reaction to insulin, radocontrast media used in certain
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 116AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 116types of medical tests. and rarely during the administra-tion of local anesthetics.
Diagnosis
Allergies can often be diagnosed by a careful med-ical history, matching the onset of symptoms to theexposure to possible allergens. Allergy is suspected ifthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergicreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure tothe suspected allergan. Allergy testscan be used toidentify potential allergens, but these must be supportedby eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-cal history.Skin testsSkin tests are performed by administering a tinydose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is appliedto the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-gen may produce a classic immune wheal and flareresponse (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressiblearea surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually beginwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin tosmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. Apositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-gen is at levels normally encountered in food or in theairways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximatelyfifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin testsinvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of theskin. These tests are more sensitive and are used forallergies associated with risk of death, such as allergiesto antibiotics.Allergen-Specific IgE MeasurementTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodiesgenerally follow a basic method. The allergen is boundto a solid support, either in the form of a cellulosesponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’sserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubatedwith the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodiesare present, they will bind to the solid phase and beretained there when the rest of the serum is washedaway. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is addedand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase. The excessis washed away and the levels of IgE are determined.The commonly used RAST test (radio allergo sorbent

Someresearch indicates that there is a higher level of totalserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-ple. However, this may not always be the case as there isconsiderable overlap between the two groups.This test isuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitisand bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other conditions thatare not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-els such as smoking,AIDS, infection with parasites,and IgE myeloma.Provocation testsThese tests involve the administration of allergen toellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-monly done with airborne allergens, present the allergendirectly through the route normally involved. Delayedallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similarmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen toinduce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-tion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen fortwo weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measuredamount of the test substance administered as an opaquecapsule along with a placebo control. Provocation testsare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to thepatient’s medical history.Future diagnostic methodsAs of 2000, attempts have been made for directmeasurement of immune mediators such as histamine,eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast celltryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-trodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.This test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-tion in the United States, though not approved by theFood and Drug Administration. An electric potential isapplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-trical resistance observed for changes. This method hasnot been verified.
Treatment
Avoiding allergens is the first line of defense toreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful toavoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, airfresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorlyvented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-places has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dustmite control is particularly important in the bedroomareas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattressand pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hotwater,and removal of items that collect dust such asstuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducingindoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduceindoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-tems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such asthe bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals shouldavoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,urine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,restriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of thehome may be beneficial.Complete environmental control is often difficult toaccomplish, hence therapuetic interventions maybecome necessary. A large number of prescription andover-the-counter drugs are available for treatment ofimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of thesework by decreasing the ability of histamine to provokesymptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-mine by stimulating other systems or reducing immuneresponses in general.AntihistaminesAntihistaminesblock the histamine receptors onnasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine releasedby mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,though they may be even more effective when used pre-ventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines arehelp reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A widevariety of antihistamines are available.Older, first generation antihistamines often producedrowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry mouth, tachycardia, blurred vision,constipation, and lower thethreshold for seizures. These medicatios also have simi-lar effects to a alcohol and care should be taken whenoperating motor vehicles, as individuals may not beaware that they are impared. Such antihistamines includethe following:• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)• clemastine (Tavist and generics)Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsinessor pass the blood-brain barrier are available by prescrip-tion and include the following:• loratidine (Claritin)

Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.DecongestantsDecongestantsconstrict blood vessels to themucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. Thisdecreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngealand sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal lin-ing and oral systemicpreparations are available. Decon-gestants are stimulants and may cause increased heartrate and blood pressure, headaches,insomnia,agitation,and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of topicaldecongestants for longer than several days can causeloss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in whichnasal passages become more severely swollen thanbefore treatment.Topical corticosteroidsTopical corticosteroidsreduce mucous membraneinflammationas by decreasing the amount of fluidmoved from the vascular spaces into the tissues. Thesemedications reduce the recruitment of inflammatorycells as well as the synthesis of cytokines. They areavailable by prescription. Allergies tend to becomeworse as the season progresses because the immune sys-tem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and canproduce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticos-teroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonalsensitization because they work more slowly and lastlonger than most other medication types. As a result,they are best started before allergy season begins. Sideeffects are usually mild, but may include headaches,nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.Bronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)Because allergic reactions involving the lungs causethe airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in asthma,

In a future exposure to the same substance,the antibodies on the mast cells bind to theallergens, and the cells release their histamine.
Histamine travels to receptor sites in the nasalpassages. When histamine molecules enter thesites they trigger dilation of the blood vessels,swelling, irritation, and increased productionof mucus.
Antihistamine drugs block histamine moleculesfrom entering receptor sites, thus preventing orreducing swelling, congestion and irritation.

It acts as a preventive treatment if it isbegun several weeks before the onset of the allergy sea-son. It can also be used for year round allergy preven-tion.

LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. These medications areuseful for individuals with aspirinsensitivity,sinusitis,polposis, urticaria. Examples include zafirlukast (Acco-late),montelukast (Singulair), and zileuton (Zyflo).When zileuton is used, care must be taken to measureliver enzymes.ImmunotherapyIn this form of therapy, allergen is injected into theskin in increasing doses over a specific period of time.This may be helpful for patients who do not respond tomedications or avoidance of allergens in the environ-ment. This type of therapy may reduce the need for med-ications.Treatment of contact dermatitisAn individual suffering from contact dermatitisshould initially take steps to avoid possible wources ofexposure to the offending agent. Calamine lotion appliedto affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat, as cancold water compresses. Side effects of topical agentsmay include over-drying of the skin.In the case of acutecontact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapymay be appropriate. Moderately strong coricosteroidscan also be applied as a wrap for twenty-four hours.Health care workers are especially at risk for hand erup-tions due to glove use.Treatment of anaphylaxisThe emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treatedwith injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.People who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food orinsect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containingadrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other medicationsmay be given to aid the action of the epi-pen. Promptinjection can prevent a more serious reaction fromdeveloping. Paticular care should be taken to assess theaffected individual’s airway status, and he or she shouldbe placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter-mined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or aninjection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximalto the area where the agent penetrated the skin. Thisshould then be released at intervals of ten minutes at atime, for one to two minutes duration. If the individualdoes not respond to such interventions, then emergencytreatment is appropriate.Alternative treatment
Any alternative treatment for allergies begins withfinding the cause and then helping the patient to avoidor eliminate the allergen, although this is not alwayspossible. As with any alternative therapy, a physicianshould be consulted before initiating a new form oftreatment. Education on the use of alternative agents iscritical, as they are still “drugs” even though they arederived from natural sources.Various categories ofalternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-ment, including:• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-peridin act as natural anithistamines.• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remediesFerrum phosphoricumand Kali muriaticum(used alter-nately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteineare believed to have decongestant effects.• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin andhesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea(Echinaceaspp.) and astragalus or milk-vetch root (Astragalus mem-branaceus) may possibly help to strengthen theimmune system.• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra ( Ephedrasinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinesemedicine), khellin (Ammi visnaga) and cramp bark(Viburnum opulus) are believed to help open the airways.Treatment of contact dermatitisA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-ly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-ment of contact dermatitis. A poultice (crushed herbsapplied directly to the affected area) made of jewelweed(Impatiensspp.) or chickweed (Stellaria media) may soothe the skin. A cream or wash containing calendula(Calendula officinalis), a natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agent, may help heal the rash whenapplied topically. Homeopathic treatment may includesuch remedies as Rhus toxicodendron,Apis mellifica,o r Anacardiumtaken internally. A qualified homeopathicpractitioner should be consulted to match the symptomswith the correct remedy. Care should be taken with anyagent taken internally.
Prognosis
Allergies can improve over time, although they oftenworsen. While anaphylaxis and severe asthma are life-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 121AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 121threatening, other allergic reactions are not. Learning torecognize and avoid allergy-provoking situations allowsmost people with allergies to lead normal lives.
Prevention
Avoiding allergens is the best means of limitingallergic reactions. For food allergies, there is no effectivetreatment except avoidance. By determining the allergensthat are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoidallergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergenssuch as poison ivy or latex. Airborne allergens are moredifficult to avoid, although keeping dust and animal dan-der from collecting in the house may limit exposure.Cromolyn sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation,thereby limiting the allergic response.Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization orallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types inthe body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to causeallergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by aller-gy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi-ble. Injections involve very small but graduallyincreasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks ormonths, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may takeup to several years to achieve and are not seen at all inabout one in five patients. Individuals receiving allshots will be monitored closely following each shotbecause of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp dropin blood pressure.Other drugs, including steroids, are used to preventasthma attacks and in the long-term management of asthma.Resources

Definition
Allergy tests indicate a person’s allergic sensitivityto commonly encountered environmental substances.
Purpose
Allergy is a reaction of the immune system. Nor-mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on theforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaledallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tinyhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,and milk.Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells inthe immune system known as mast cells. Mast cellsserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets theoutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of theeyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratoryand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special typeof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), ontheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicalsin small packets, called granules. When the antibodiesencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of thesechemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of theseother cells, through special proteins called histaminereceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors onblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increasedredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritatedeyes. Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, causingthe itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common inallergic rhinitis.The particular allergens to which a person is sensi-tive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergytests may be performed on the skin or using blood serumin a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens areplaced on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s bloodserum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-mine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo-cation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 122Allergy testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 122gen, either through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reac-tions from any of these tests may be used to narrow thecandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.Identification of the allergenic substance may allowthe patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergicreactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done inthose with asthmathat is difficult to manage, eczema, orskin rashesto determine if an allergy is causing the con-dition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be donebefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety ofmore extensive exposure.Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test.There are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. Inpercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions areplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with aneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin andbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in whichthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used lessoften. Intradermal testing involves directly injectingallergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,swollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-stance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity isseen for allergens regardless of whether they usuallyaffect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-gens cause skin reactions equally well.The range of allergens used for testing is chosen toreflect possible sources in the environment and mayinclude the following:• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, andweeds• mold and fungus spores• house dust• house mites• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva• food extracts• antibiotics• insect venomsRadio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratorytest performed when a person may be too sensitive to riskskin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-vent it.Provocation testing is done to positively identifysuspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-fied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested inincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provokea response. Food testing is much more tedious thaninhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-tive system may take a day or more.
Precautions
While allergy tests are quite safe for most people,the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxisdoes exist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop inblood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-laxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin testsshould never include a substance known to cause ana-phylaxis in the person being tested.Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.Therefore, treatment medications should be available fol-lowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.
Description
In prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be testedis placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergendrops, including a drop of saline solution that should notprovoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-mine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). Asmall needle is inserted through the drop, and used toprick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.The sites are examined over the next twenty minutes forevidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positivereaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-tions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections aremade for each allergen tested. Observations are madeover the next twenty minutes.In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use inthe laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum isseparated from the blood cells. The serum is thenexposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a per-son has antibodies to a particular allergen, those antibod-

Location of allergen-antibody combinations isdone by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so calledanti-antibodies, that are chemically linked with aradioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on thesolid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.Provocation testing may be performed to identify air-borne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performedonly after a patient’s lung capacity and response to themedium used to dilute the allergen has been determined.Once this has been determined, the patient inhales increas-ingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen, fol-lowed each time by measurement of the exhalation capaci-ty. Only one allergen is tested per day. Testing for foodallergiesis usually done by removing the suspect foodfrom the diet for two weeks, followed by eating a singleportion of the suspect food and follow-up monitoring.
Preparation
Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination ofthe skin. The patient should refrain from using anti-aller-gy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior toinhalation testing, patients with asthma who can tolerateit may be asked to stop any asthma medications. Testingfor food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspectfood for at least two weeks before testing.
Aftercare
Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare. Ageneralized redness and swelling may occur in the testarea, but it will usually resolve within a day or two.Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma attacks,even if the antigen administered in the test initially pro-duced no response. Severe initial reactions may justifyclose professional observation for at least 12 hours aftertesting.Risks
Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in theinjection of the allergen into the circulation, with anincreased risk of adverse reactions. Inhalation tests mayprovoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or unsuspect-ed allergens in any test carries the risk of anaphylaxis.Because patients are monitored following allergy testing,an anaphylactic reaction is usually recognized and treat-ed promptly. Occasionally, a delayed anaphylacticresponse can occur that will require immediate care.Proper patient education regarding how to recognize ana-phylaxis is vital.
Normal results
Lack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicatesno allergic response. In an inhalation test, the exhalationcapacity should remain unchanged. In a food challenge,no symptoms should occur.
Abnormal results
Presence of redness or swelling, especially over 5mm (1/4 inch) in diameter, indicates an allergic response.

Alopecia
Definition
Alopecia simply means hair loss (baldness).
Description
Hair loss occurs for a great many reasons—frompulling it out to having it killed off by cancer chemo-therapy. Some causes are considered natural, while oth-ers signal serious health problems. Some conditions areconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughoutthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-nents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in thebody.Oftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalpwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific causeis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-ness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, orhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is thecondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimesonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visiblydiseased as well.Causes and symptoms
• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-ered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized bythe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of thehead and by the healthy condition of the scalp.• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknowncause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hairloss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’sfootand ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder thatcauses a person to pull out his/her own hair.• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancerchemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.Placing a tourniquet around the skull just above the earsduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs mayreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugsfrom reaching the scalp.• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-tively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One exampleis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism(too much thy-roid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.

Quin.Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 125Hypothyroidism(too little thyroid hormone) thickensboth hair and skin.• Several autoimmune diseases (when protective cellsbegin to attack self cells within the body) affect theskin, notably lupus erythematosus.
Diagnosis
Dermatologists are skilled in diagnosis by sightalone. For more obscure diseases, they may have toresort to a skin biopsy, removing a tiny bit of skin usinga local anesthetic so that it can examined under a micro-scope. Systemic diseases will require a complete evalua-tion by a physician, including specific tests to identifyand characterize the problem.
Treatment
Successful treatment of underlying causes is mostlikely to restore hair growth, be it the completion ofchemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or controlof a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs—minox-idil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)—promote hairgrowth in a significant minority of patients, especiallythose with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata.While both drugs have so far proved to be quite safewhen used for this purpose,minoxidilis a liquid that isapplied to the scalp and finasteride is the first and onlyapproved treatment in a pill form.Minoxidil was approved for over-the-counter salesin 1996. When used continuously for long periods ofKEY TERMS
Athlete’s foot—A fungal infection between thetoes, officially known as tinea pedis.Autoimmune disease—Certain diseases caused bythe body’s development of an immune reaction toits own tissues.Chemotherapy—The treatment of diseases, usual-ly cancer, with drugs (chemicals).Hair follicles—Tiny organs in the skin, each one ofwhich grows a single hair.Lupus erythematosus—An autoimmune diseasethat can damage skin, joints, kidneys, and otherorgans.Ringworm—A fungal infection of the skin, usuallyknown as tinea corporis.Systemic—Affecting all or most parts of the body.time, minoxidil produces satisfactory results in about onequarter of patients with androgenic alopecia and as manyas half the patients with alopecia areata. There is also anover-the-counter extra-strength version of minoxidil (5%concentration) approved for use by men only. The treat-ment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighterin color. It is important to note that new hair stops grow-ing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued.Over the past few decades there have appeared amultitude of hair replacement methods performed byboth physicians and non-physicians. They range fromsimply weaving someone else’s hair in with the remainsof your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hairfollicles one at a time.Hair transplantationis completed by taking tinyplugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs,from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections arethen implanted with the plugs. Research completed in2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, andfound that micrografts (one to two hairs transplantedper follicle) resulted in fewer complications and thebest resultsAnother surgical procedure used to treat androgenicalopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin the hair-less scalp can be removed and the area of bald skindecreased by closing the space with hair-covered scalp.Hair-bearing skin can also be folded over an area of baldskin with a technique called a flap.
Prognosis
The prognosis varies with the cause. It is generallymuch easier to lose hair than to regrow it. Even when itreturns, it is often thin and less attractive than the original.Resources

Alpha-fetoprotein test
Definition
The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test thatis performed during pregnancy. This screening test mea-sures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-cates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-ous birth defects. The level of AFP can also be deter-mined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. Thisscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; itonly indicates the increase of risk for several birthdefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detectliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitorthe progress of cancertreatment.
Purpose
Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by theliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein isunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producingAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine andsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enterthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. Byanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probabilitythat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is veryimportant that the doctor know precisely how old thefetus is when the test is performed since the AFP levelchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFPscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test isused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate lineof testing (like amniocentesisor ultrasound) follows,based on the results.Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetushas an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the mostcommon and severe type of disorder associated withincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinalcolumn defects (spina bifida) and anencephaly (asevere and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tubethat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not closecorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leakthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amnioticfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels ofAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If thescreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-sound is used to diagnosis the problem.Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levelsabove normal include:• cysts at the end of the spine• blockage in the esophagus or intestines• liver disease causing liver cells to die• defects in the abdominal wall• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease• brittle bone diseaseLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid inthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along thanestimated.For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP mayindicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition thatincludes mental retardationand a distinctive physicalappearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicatesan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP canalso occur when the fetus has died or when the motheris overweight.AFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test thatanalyzes three substances as risk indicators of possiblebirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-sured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the testresults increases.Although AFP in human blood gradually disappearsafter birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear inliver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.The AFP test is used to screen people at high risk forthese conditions. After a cancerous tumor is removed, an
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 127Alpha-fetoprotein testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 127AFP test can monitor the progress of treatment. Contin-ued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.
Precautions
It is very important that the doctor know preciselyhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since theAFP level considered normal changes over the length ofthe pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetuslead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since anAFP test is only a screening tool, more specific testsmust follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormaltest result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has abirth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results(either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetusthat has a serious condition.
Description
The AFP test is usually performed at week 16 ofpregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on theinside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam-ple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis.Test results are usually available after about one week.
Preparation
There is no specific physical preparation for the AFPtest.
Aftercare
There is no specific aftercare involved with thisscreening test.
Risks
The risks associated with drawing blood are mini-mal, but may include bleeding from the puncture site,feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn, orblood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma).
Normal results
Alpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms permilliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability. TheKEY TERMS

An AFPlevel less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered nor-mal.
Abnormal results
The doctor will inform the woman of her specificincreased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan-dard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater thanthe standard risk for women who are 35 years old orolder (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended.Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormalAFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that hasDown’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk;appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor-mal screening result.In tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP levelgreater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.Resources

Definition
Alpha1-adrenergic blockers are drugs that work byblocking the alpha
1-receptors of vascular smooth muscle,thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines by thesmooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and allowsblood to flow more easily.
Purpose
These drugs, called alpha blockers for short, areused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure(hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterizedby an enlarged prostategland.High blood pressureHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart andthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage theblood vessels to the point of causing stroke,heart fail-ureor kidney failure. People with high blood pressuremay also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controllinghigh blood pressure makes these problems less likely.Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causingvasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of theblood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)This condition particularly affects older men. Overtime, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-der, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere withthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.Men who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinatemore often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-ly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-traction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-cles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine toflow more freely.
Description
Commonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-sion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also usedin the treatment of heart failure. All are available onlywith a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dose depends on the patient andthe type of alpha blocker and may change over the courseof treatment. The prescribing physician will graduallyincrease the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may needas much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per dayof doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,but most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosageincreases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,even if the medication does not seem to be working atfirst. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improvebecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.Patients should avoid missing any doses, and should nottake larger or more frequent doses to make up formissed doses.
Precautions
Alpha blockers may lower blood pressure to agreater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting. Activ- ities such as driving, using machines, or doing anythingelse that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking thefirst dose should be avoided. Patients should be remindedto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in themiddle of the night. The same precautions are recom-mended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has beenstopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety onthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers shouldinform his or her physician, so that the physician cantake this factor into account when increasing dosage.Dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-ly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drinkalcohol,exercise, stand for a long time, or are exposed tohot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-tions and alcohol consumption should be limited.Some people may feel drowsy or less alert whenusing these drugs. They should accordingly avoid drivingor performing activities that require full attention.People diagnosed with kidney disease or liver diseasemay also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They shouldinform their physicians about these conditions if alphablockers are prescribed. Older people may also be moresensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted sideeffects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness.It should be noted that alpha blockers do not curehigh blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi-tion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrinkan enlarged prostate gland. Although they will helprelieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, theprostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may benecessary to have prostate surgery.Alpha blockers may lower blood counts. Patientsmay need to have their blood checked regularly whiletaking this medicine.

The physician should alsobe told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,or other substances.The effects of taking alpha blockers during preg- nancyare not fully understood. Women who are preg-nant or planning to become pregnant should inform theirphysicians. Breastfeeding mothers who need to takealpha blockers should also talk to their physicians. Thesedrugs can pass into breast milk and may affect nursingbabies. It may be necessary to stop breastfeeding whilebeing treated with alpha blockers.

Alport syndrome
Definition
A hereditary disease of the kidneys that primarilyaffects men, causing blood in the urine,hearing lossand eye problems. Eventually,kidney dialysisor transplantmay be necessary.
Description
Alport syndrome affects about one in 5,000 Ameri-cans, striking men more often and severely than women.There are several varieties of the syndrome, some occur-ring in childhood and others not causing symptoms untilmen reach their 20s or 30s. All varieties of the syndromeare characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-gresses to chronic kidney failureand by uremia (thepresence of excessive amounts of urea and other wasteproducts in the blood).
Causes and symptoms
Alport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defectin one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It isusually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-er. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-tory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be aspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark ofAlport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear invarying combinations include:• protein in the urine (proteinuria)• sensorineural hearing loss• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements(nystagmus),cataracts, or cornea problems]• skin problems• platelet disorders• abnormal white blood cells• smooth muscle tumorsKEY TERMS
Albumin—A protein that is important in maintain-ing blood volume. Low albumin levels is one signof Alport syndrome.Dialysis—A technique of removing waste materialfrom the blood. It is used with patients whose kid-neys have stopped functioning and can no longercleanse the blood on their own.Diuretic—A drug that increases the amount ofurine a person produces.Hematuria—Blood in the urine, Hematuria is ahallmark of Alport syndrome.Pulmonary edema—Excess fluid in the air spacesof the lungs.Uremia—The presence of excessive amounts ofurea and other waste products in the blood.Not all patients with Alport syndrome have hearingproblems. In general, those with normal hearing haveless severe cases of Alport syndrome.
Diagnosis
Alport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu-ation and family history, together with a kidney biopsythat can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condi-tion. Urinalysismay reveal blood or protein in the urine.Blood tests can reveal a low platelet level.In addition, tests for the Alport gene are now avail-able. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered bymany types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnoseaffected children even before birth, and genetic linkagetests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn-drome are also available.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alportsyndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the problemsrelated to kidney failure, such as the presence of toomany waste products in the blood (uremia).To control kidney inflammation (nephritis), patients should:• restrict fluids• control high blood pressure• manage pulmonary edema
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 131Alport syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 131• control high blood levels of potassiumRarely patients with Alport syndrome may developnephrotic syndrome, a group of symptoms includingtoo much protein in the urine, low albumin levels, andswelling. To ease these symptoms, patients should:• drink less• eat a salt-free diet• use diuretics• have albumin transfusionsThe treatment for chronic kidney failure is dialysisor a kidney transplant.
Prognosis
Women with this condition can lead a normal life,although they may have slight hearing loss. An affectedwoman may notice blood in her urine only when understressor pregnant.Men generally have a much more serious problemwith the disease. Most will experience kidney disease intheir 20s or 30s, which may eventually require dialysis ortransplantation, and many develop significant hearingloss. Men with Alport syndrome often die of complica-tions by middle age.
Prevention
Alport syndrome is a genetic disease and preventionefforts are aimed at providing affected individuals andtheir families with information concerning the geneticmechanisms responsible for the disease. Since it is possi-ble to determine if a woman is a carrier, or if an unbornchild has the condition,genetic counselingcan providehelpful information and support for the decisions thataffected individuals and their families may have to make.Resources

Altitude sickness
Definition
Altitude sickness is a general term encompassing aspectrum of disorders that occur at higher altitudes.Since the severity of symptoms varies with altitude, it isimportant to understand the range of the different alti-tudes that may be involved. High altitude is defined asheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitudeis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined asheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majorityof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness whenthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% ofpeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one daywill develop altitude sickness. Children under six yearsand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles maybe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medicalconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—maybecome sick at more moderate altitudes.
Description
There are three major clinical syndromes that fallunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountainsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema(HACE). These syndromes are not separate, individual syndromesas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resultingfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,and the other two represent severe, life-threatening formsof altitude sickness.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 132Altitude sicknessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressureof oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is aterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the termconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygendrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, thereis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for theindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygenreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These twoconditions are the major factors that form the basis for allthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.As a person becomes hypoxemic, his naturalresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). Thisis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapidrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxiaat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and itoccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is aresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lowerto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who havelived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayanand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhapsthrough a genetic ability.
Causes and symptoms
Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form ofaltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes highergreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia isassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-firmed. It is important to realize that some individualsacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer fromAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibilityof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer fromAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the secondor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usuallyabates after three to five days if they remain at the samealtitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel toan even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a fewhours to a few days following ascent, and they includedizziness,headache,shortness of breath, nausea, vomit-ing, loss of appetite, and insomnia.High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening condition that afflicts a small percentage ofthose who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaksfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lungtissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lungtissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins toKEY TERMS

HAPE is knownto afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their levelof physical fitness.Typically, the individual who suffers from HAPEascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-ly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, acoughproductive of a large amount of sometimes bloodysputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-tance is provided by this point, the patient goes into acomaand dies within a few hours.High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest andmost severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebraledema, and its mechanism of development is also poorlyunderstood. The symptoms often begin with those ofAMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered levelof consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,loss of coordination,hallucinations, and even seizures.If no intervention is implemented,deathis the result.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis for altitude sickness may be madefrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-ing travel to higher altitudes.
Treatment
Mild AMS requires no treatment other than anaspirinor ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-ther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because theymay blunt the respiratory response, making it even moredifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidlyenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen inthe environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviatesymptoms of mild AMS.As for HAPE and HACE, the most important courseof action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-ble. Even a 1,000-2,000 -foot (305–610 m) descent can
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 133Altitude sicknessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 133dramatically improve one’s symptoms. If descent is notpossible, oxygen therapy should be started. In addition,dexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order toreduce cerebral edema.
Prognosis
The prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriatemeasures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog-nosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descentand the availability of medical intervention. Descentoften leads to improvement of symptoms, however,recovery times vary among individuals.
Prevention
When individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-mended that they spend at least one night at an interme-diate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. Ingeneral, climbers should take at least two days to gofrom sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reachingthat point, healthy climbers should generally allow oneday for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one dayof rest should be taken every two or three days. Shouldmild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should beavoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individualshould return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicatethat acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken beforeascent as a preventative measure for AMS.Paying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-tude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,so climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-duce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clearurine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should beavoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydratesnacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods) canhelp, especially in the first few days of climbing.Resources

Definition
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common formof dementia, a neurologic disease characterized by lossof mental ability severe enough to interfere with normalactivities of daily living, lasting at least six months, andnot present from birth. AD usually occurs in old age, andis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such asremembering, reasoning, and planning.
Description
A person with AD usually has a gradual decline inmental functions, often beginning with slight memoryloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintainemployment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and toreason and exercisejudgment. Communication ability,mood, and personality may also be affected. Most peoplewho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,although that interval may be as short as one year or aslong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death in adults after heart disease,cancer, and stroke.Between two and four million Americans have AD;that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the 21st century as the population as a wholeages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50sdevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all peoplebetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly morewomen than men are affected with AD, but this may bebecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higherproportion of women in the most affected age groups.The costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-erable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient withmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual directand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the UnitedStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for athome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety ofhealth care institutions.
Causes and symptoms
CausesThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease areunknown. Some strong leads have been found throughrecent research, however, and these have also given sometheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 134Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts ofthe brain that control memory, including the hippocam-pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controlsshort-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampusstop functioning, the short-term memory of the personfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areasresponsible for language and reasoning; this languageskills are lost and the ability to make judgments ischanged. Personality changes occur, which may includeemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-ity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink andlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.Autopsyof a person with AD shows that the regionsof the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. InAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twistedand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems, manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’sability to perform normal activities of daily living.What triggers the formation of plaques and tanglesand the development of AD are unknown. AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,environmental, and others not yet identified. Two typesof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, withno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described interms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring inpeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 ofAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some casesof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than themore common late-on-set type.All FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that havebeen identified so far are the early on-set type. As manyas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes. Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells.There is no evidence that the mutated genes thatcause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene onthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), calledAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent, and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies ofone. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect somepeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found inthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to thosewithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about threetimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those withtwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as muchas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyonewith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it canstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases thechances of developing AD is not known with certainty.However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involveinteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup. In2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genomewere identified, where one out of several hundred genesin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to makea contribution to the risk of developing late-onset ADthat is at least as important as APOE e4.Other non-genetic factors have also been studied inrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brainmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons- teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) seems toreduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of bloodflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting forthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases bloodflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactivemolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells ofall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect againstfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’sdisease are still unknown, there are several risk factorsthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; olderpeople develop AD at much higher rates than youngerones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may belinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinicallycontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterollevels may also be important. Scientists have shown thathigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rateof plaque deposition. There are also parallels betweenAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disordersthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.Numerous epidemiological studies of populations arealso being conducted to learn more about whether and towhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, andethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. Forexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years ofschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-ever, the low educational attainment that was identified asa risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-terious socioeconomic or environmental influences inchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpretingepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of theissues and the large number of variables involved.Many environmental factors have been suspected ofcontributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-ies have not borne out these links. Among these havebeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, noneof these factors has been shown to cause AD or increaseits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links toother environmental factors.SymptomsThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-ally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memorylapses are of course common to everyone, and do not bythemselves signify any change in cognitive function. Theperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort ofmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—butprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such asforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becominglost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhoodbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A personwith AD may forget the names of family members, orforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence bythe time he hears the end.As AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-ing inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,and personality or behavior changes. Some patients havetrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-drome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the sameideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior knownas perseveration. In the final stages people may havesevere problems with eating, communicating, and con-trolling their bladder and bowel functions.The Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of tenwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:• memory loss that affects job skills• difficulty performing familiar tasks• problems with language• disorientation of time and place• poor or decreased judgment• problems with abstract thinking• misplacing things• changes in mood or behavior• changes in personality• loss of initiativeOther types of dementia, including some that arereversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important forthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-fessional who can weigh the possibility that his or hersymptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% ofthose originally suspected of having AD turn out to havesome other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 136Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 136Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, andmay require office visits to several different specialistsover several months before a diagnosis can be made.While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made inmost cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be defini-tively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brainfor plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi-cal exam and complete medical history. Except in thedisease’s earliest stages, accurate history from familymembers or caregivers is essential. Since there are bothprescription and over-the-counter drugs that can causethe same mental changes as AD, a careful review of thepatient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-ical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-tia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).These possibilities must be ruled out as well throughappropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso-nance imaging(MRI),positron emission tomography(PET) or single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity(electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Severaltypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the ADdiagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests ofmental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen-tration. Still, the neurologic examis normal in mostpatients in early stages.One of the most important parts of the diagnosticprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression anddelirium, since each of these can be present with AD,or may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves adecreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ-ment.) Depression and memory loss are both commonin the elderly, and the combination of the two can oftenbe mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated withdrugs, although some antidepressants can worsendementia if it is present, further complicating both diag-nosis and treatment.An early and accurate diagnosis of AD is importantin developing strategies for managing symptoms and forhelping patients and their families planning for the futureand pursuing care options while the patient can still takepart in the decision-making process.A genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, butis not used for diagnosis, since possessing even twocopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. Inaddition, access to genetic information could affect theinsurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affectemployment status and legal rights.
Treatment
Alzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there-fore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD isgood nursing care, providing both physical and emotion-al support for a person who is gradually able to do lessand less for himself, and whose behavior is becomingmore and more erratic. Modifications of the home toincrease safety and security are often necessary. Thecaregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,and burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becomingfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-ing the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,can help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-cult process of the disease. Regular medical care by apractitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD isimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratoryinfections can be diagnosed and treated properly, ratherthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable declineseen in AD.People with AD are also often depressed or anxious,and may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition, and general poor health. Each of these conditions is treatableto some degree. It is important for the person with AD toeat well and continue to exercise. Professional advicefrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,easy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable tothose requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise(supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overallhealth. A calm, structured environment with simple ori-entation aids (such as calendars and clocks) may reduceanxietyand increase safety. Other psychiatric symptoms,such as depression, anxiety,hallucinations(seeing orhearing things that aren’t there), and delusions(false beliefs) may be treated with drugs if necessary.

Reproduced bypermission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 137DrugsAs of 2000, only three drugs—tacrine (Cognex),donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine(Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its treat-ment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv-ing memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod-erate AD, and even then in less than half of those who takeit. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, butit may delay the need for nursing home admission. Themost significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzymeknown as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak-ing tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor theirALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,vomiting,diarrhea, abdominal pain,indigestion, and skin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month inearly 1998, with additional costs for the weekly bloodmonitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to becost-effective for those who respond to it, since it maydecrease the number of months a patient needs nursingcare. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treatmild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helpssome patients for periods of time ranging from months toabout two years. Donepezil has two advantages overtacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given oncedaily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does notappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does notrequire weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominalside effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-mately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in Aprilof 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patientsto carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,decrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-tation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,memory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of theother two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stopsor reverses the progression of AD.Estrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-scribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo- porosis. Several preliminary studies have shown thatwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and thosewho develop AD have a slower progression and lesssevere symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear tohave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.Preliminary studies have also suggested a reducedrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly usenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-ing aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-minophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-acteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect ofthe disease is not yet known.Antioxidants, which act to inhibit and protectagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, havebeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-sue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to seewhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.Another antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought todelay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due tothe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to anincrease in the overall health of those taking it.Drugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, andsedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders) of AD. Research is being conducted to search for bettertreatments, including non-drug approaches for ADpatients.Nursing care and safetyThe person with Alzheimer’s disease will graduallylose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use thetoilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, hemay be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-son’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency towander may make it difficult to leave him unattended foreven a few minutes and make even the home a potentiallydangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibitinappropriate sexual behaviors.The nursing care required for a person with AD iswell within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-ficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant butunpredictable nature of the demands put on them. Inaddition, the personality changes undergone by a personwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as aloved one deteriorates, seeming to become a differentperson. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:some become quite gentle, and spend increasing amountsof time in dreamlike states.A loss of good grooming may be one of the earlysymptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,and decreased interest in personal hygiene become morecommon. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find thesechanges socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with.The caregiver will usually need to spend increasingamounts of time for grooming to compensate for the lossof attention from the patient, although some adjustmentof expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is oftenneeded as the disease progresses.Proper nutrition is important for a person with AD,and may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure theperson is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move-ment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube maybe placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Afeeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easyto care for if the patient is not resistant to its use.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 138Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 138For many caregivers, incontinence becomes themost difficult problem to deal with at home, and is aprincipal reason for pursuing nursing home care. In theearly stages, limiting fluid intake and increasing the fre-quency of toileting can help. Careful attention to hygieneis important to prevent skin irritation and infection fromsoiled clothing.Persons with dementia must deal with six basic safe-ty concerns: injury from falls, injury from ingesting dan-gerous substances, leaving the home and getting lost,injury to self or others from sharp objects, fire or burns, and the inability to respond rapidly to crisis situations. Inall cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longerbe allowed to drive, because of the increased potentialfor accidents and the increased likelihood of wanderingvery far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim-ple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed railson the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great-ly increase safety. Electrical appliances should beunplugged and put away when not in use, and matches,lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely outof reach. The hot water heater temperature may be setlower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergencynumbers, including the poison control center and thehospital emergency room, should be posted by thephone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri-odically reevaluate the physical safety of the home andintroduce new strategies for continued safety.Care for the caregiverFamily members or others caring for a person withAD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, whichbecomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementiacaregivers spend significantly more time on caregivingthan do people providing care for those with other typesof illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greaterimpact in terms of employment complications, caregiverstrain, mental and physical health problems, time forleisure and other family members, and family conflictthan do other types of caregiving. It is common for ADcaregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel fortheir loved one and for themselves. Depression is anextremely common consequence of being a full-timecaregiver for a person with AD. Support groups are animportant way to deal with the stressof caregiving.Becoming a member of an AD caregivers’ support groupcan be one of the most important things a family memberdoes, not only for him or herself, but for the person withAD as well. The location and contact numbers for ADcaregiver support groups are available from theAlzheimer’s Association; they may also be availablethrough a local social service agency, the patient’s physi-cian, or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture thedrugs used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depressionmay be an important adjunct to group support.Outside help, nursing homes, and governmentalassistanceMost families eventually need outside help to relievesome of the burden of around-the-clock care for a personwith AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer orpaid, may be available through local social service agen-cies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasinglycommon. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respitecare may be available as well.Providing the total care required by a person withlate-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for afamily, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami-lies consider nursing home care. This decision is often oneof the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen asan abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami-ly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler-gy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of thistransition. Selecting a nursing home may require a difficultbalancing of cost, services, location, and availability.Keeping the entire family involved in the decision mayhelp prevent further stress from developing later on.Several federal government programs may ease thecost of caring for a person with AD, including SocialSecurity Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Securi-ty Income. Each of these programs may provide someassistance for care, medication, or other costs, but noneof them will pay for nursing home care indefinitely.Medicaid is a state-funded program that may provide forsome or all of the cost of nursing home care, althoughthere are important restrictions. Details of the benefitsand eligibility requirements of these programs are avail-able through the local Social Security or Medicaid office,or from local social service agencies.Private long-term care insurance, special “reversemortgages,” viatical insurance, and other financial devicesare other ways of paying for care for those with the appro-priate financial situations. Further information on theseoptions may be available through resources listed below.
Alternative treatment
Several substances are currently being tested fortheir ability to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease.These include acetylcarnitine, a supplement that acts onthe cellular energy structures known as mitochondria.Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo bilobatree, appears to have antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties. Ginkgo
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 139Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 139extract has been used for many years in China and iswidely prescribed in Europe for treatment of circulatoryproblems. A 1997 study of patients with dementiaseemed to show that ginkgo extract could improve theirsymptoms, though the study was criticized for certainflaws in its method.Large scale follow-up studies arebeing conducted to determine whether Ginkgo extractcan prevent or delay the development of AD. Ginkgoextract is available in many health food or nutritionalsupplement stores. Some alternative practitioners alsoadvise people with AD to take supplements of phos-phatidylcholine, vitamin B
12, gotu kola, ginseng, St.John’s Wort, rosemary, saiko-keishi-to-shakuyaku (AJapanese herbal mixture), and folic acid.
Prognosis
While Alzheimer’s disease may not be the directcause of death, the generally poorer health of a personwith AD increases the risk of life-threatening infection,including pneumonia. In addition, other diseases com-mon in old age—cancer, stroke, and heart disease—maylead to more severe consequences in a person with AD.On average, people with AD live eight years past theirdiagnosis, with a range from one to 20 years.
Prevention
There is currently no sure way to prevent Alzheimer’sdisease, although some of the drug treatments discussedabove may eventually be proven to reduce the risk ofdeveloping the disease. The most likely current candidatesare estrogen, NSAIDs, vitamin E, and ginkgo biloba, although this list may grow or shrink with further research.KEY TERMS
Acetylcholine—One of the substances in the bodythat helps transmit nerve impulses.Dementia—Impaired intellectual function thatinterferes with normal social and work activities.Ginkgo—An herb from the Ginkgo bilobatree thatsome alternative practitioners recommend for theprevention and treatment of AD.Neurofibrillary tangle—Twisted masses of proteininside nerve cells that develop in the brains ofpeople with AD.Senile plaque—Structures composed of parts ofneurons surrounding brain proteins called beta-amyloid deposits and found in the brains of peo-ple with AD.Research on the prevention of AD is focusing onblocking the production of amyloid in the brain as wellas breaking down beta-amyloid once it is released fromcells but before it has a chance to aggregate into insolu-ble plaques. There are also promising studies being con-ducted to develop an AD vaccine, where immuneresponses may result in the elimination of the formationof amyloid plaques.The Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADCs)program promotes research, training and education,technology transfer, and multicenter and cooperativestudies in AD, other dementias, and normal brain aging. Each ADC enrolls and performs studies on AD patientsand healthy older people. Persons can participate inresearch protocols and clinical drug trials at these cen-ters. Data from the ADCs as well as from other sourcesare coordinated and made available for use byresearchers at the National Alzheimer’s CoordinatingCenter, established in 1999.Resources

Amblyopia
Definition
Amblyopia is an uncorrectable decrease in vision inone or both eyes with no apparent structural abnormalityseen to explain it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaningthat when a decrease in vision is detected, other causesmust be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two linesor more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) betweenthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worsewould be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someonehas 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 withthe left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision withcorrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.
Description
Lazy eye is a common non-medical term used todescribe amblyopia because the eye with poorer visiondoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia isthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarityof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-ing of those images by the brain. If the images producedby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain maynot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead toamblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferringone eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-ment in the blurrier eye.
Causes and symptoms
Some of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:•Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) isthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. Thetwo eyes are looking in two different directions at thesame time. The brain is sent two different images andthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.• Anisometropia. This is another type of functionalamblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). Forexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than theother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the othereye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the twodissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrierimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause theimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataractmay become amblyopic.•Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If lightcannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, theeye is essentially not being used. This can lead toamblyopia.•Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-tional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result inamblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the Bvitaminsmay result in toxic amblyopia.• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.Barring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-dren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Childrenmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor theeye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing orreaching for things when approached from the side of theamblyopic eye. Parents should see if one side of

Diagnosis
Because children with outwardly normal eyes mayhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular visionscreenings performed for all children. While there issome controversy regarding the age children should havetheir first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,be examined at any age, even at one day of life.Some recommend that children have their visionchecked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-mologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.Others recommend testing by at least the child’s fourthbirthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable afterage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the betterthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part ofa child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eyeproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.There are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, tomeasure the refractive status of the eyes. This can helpdetermine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-heldinstrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (orinfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-tion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determinedusing a variety of methods. Many different eye charts areavailable (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters). In ambly-opia, single letters are easier to recognize than when aKEY TERMS
Anisometropia—An eye condition in which thereis an inequality of vision between the two eyes.There may be unequal amounts of nearsighted-ness, farsightedness, or astigmatism, so that oneeye will be in focus while the other will not.Cataract—Cloudiness of the eye’s natural lens.Occulsion therapy—A type of treatment for ambly-opia in which the good eye is patched for a periodof time. This forces the weaker eye to be used.Strabismus—A condition in which the eyes aremisaligned and point in different directions. Oneeye may look straight ahead, while the other turnsinward, outward, upward, or downward. This isalso called crossed-eyes.Visual acuity—Acuity is the acuteness or sharp-ness of vision.whole line is shown. This is called the “crowding effect”and helps in diagnosing amblyopia. Neutral density filtersmay also be held over the eye to aid in the diagnosis.Sometimes visual fields to determine defects in the areaof vision will be performed. Color vision testing may alsobe performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly-opia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threateningproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami-nation of the eyes and visual system is very importantwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.
Treatment
The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusiontherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopiceye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too maybecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment planshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understandhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focusand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in theweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-od of years to maintain the improvement.While patching is necessary to get the amblyopiceye to work, it is just as important to correct the reasonfor the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there areerrors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may benecessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition isindicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the goodeye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use theamblyopic eye.
Prognosis
The younger the person, the better the chance forimprovement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev-er, treatment may be successful in older children—evenadults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia alsodepends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specifictype of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-tant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-nificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The bestoutcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.
Prevention
To protect their child’s vision, parents must be awareof amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness mayencourage parents to take young children for vision examsearly on in life—certainly before school age. Proper nutri-tion is important in the avoidance of toxic amblyopia.

Amebiasis
Definition
Amebiasis is an infectious disease caused by a para-sitic one-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Enta- moeba histolytica. Persons with amebiasis may experi-ence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea, fever, and cramps. The disease may also affect theintestines, liver, or other parts of the body.
Description
Amebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is oneof the most common parasitic diseases occurring inhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases eachyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropicalareas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-quate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occurin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit anysymptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 peopledie of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-sis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrantworkers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrantsdevelop amebiasis at a higher rate.Human beings are the only known host of the amebi-asis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of ageor sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarilyspread in food and water that has been contaminated byhuman feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-tact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-al outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces areused as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-plies contaminated with human feces.Causes and symptoms
Recently, it has been discovered that persons withsymptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe- ba histolytica, and those individuals who exhibit nosymptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-looking ameba called Entamoeba dispar. During theirlife cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot movebut can survive outside the human body because of itsprotective covering, and the disease-producing form, thetrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannotinfect others. The disease is most commonly transmittedwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E. histolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tractthe cysts are transported to the intestine where the wallsof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released withinthe intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding onintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the largeintestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, thetrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinaltissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).The trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in theintestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal walland be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, orother organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestineseventually form new cysts that are carried through thedigestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorabletemperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur-vive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to beginthe cycle again.Although 90% of cases of amebiasis in the UnitedStates are mild, pregnant women, children under twoyears of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and

ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION. Most persons withamebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even thoughthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable ofinfecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-minating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,for example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.
CHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu- als may experience symptoms over a long period of timeduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experiencerecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to fourweeks and recur over a period of years. These patientsmay also suffer from abdominal cramps,fatigue, and weight loss.
AMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinalamebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-tine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severeabdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-bic dysentery may cause complications, includinginflammation of the appendix (appendicitis), a tear inthe intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severeinflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).
AMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in thebowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It canresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acuteamebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptomsthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.
PERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may pro-duce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”appearance and are painful to the touch.Extraintestinal amebiasisExtraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-ly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes allforms of the disease that affect other organs.The most common form of extraintestinal amebiasisis amebic abscessof the liver. In the United States, ame-bic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-panic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result fromdirect infection of the liver by E. histolyticaor as a com-plication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebicabscess of the liver complain of painin the chest orabdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right sidedirectly above the liver.Other forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, thoughrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,or genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-tively high mortality rate.Diagnosis
Diagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partlybecause the disease can affect several areas of the bodyand can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms tobeing severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, aphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when apatient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,diarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure toamebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,or anal intercourse.It is vital to distinguish between amebiasis andanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) thatproduces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-rectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage thegrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because ofthe serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential casesof IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samplesand blood tests, and a procedure involving a visualinspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu-lar instrument (sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.A diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by oneor more tests, depending on the location of the disease.Stool examinationThis test involves microscopically examining a stoolsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E. histolyticaand not one of the many other intestinal ame-bas that are often found but that do not cause disease. Aseries of three stool tests is approximately 90% accuratein confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu-nately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosingamebomas or extraintestinal infections.SigmoidoscopySigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure inwhich a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig-moidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part ofthe large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue orfluid samples from the intestinal lining.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 144AmebiasisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 144Blood testsAlthough tests designed to detect a specific proteinproduced in response to amebiasis infection (antibody) arecapable of detecting only about 10% of cases of mild ame-biasis, these tests are extremely useful in confirming 95%of dysentery diagnoses and 98% of liver abscess diag-noses. Blood serum will usually test positive for antibodywithin a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however,cannot always distinguish between a current or past infec-tion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood foras long as 10 years following initial infection.Imaging studiesA number of sophisticated imaging techniques, suchas computed tomography scans(CT),magnetic reso-nance imaging(MRI), and ultrasound, can be used todetermine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat-ed, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw asample of tissue to determine whether the abscess isindeed caused by an amebic infection.
Treatment
Asymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis mayrequire no treatment. However, because of the potentialfor disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with amedication to kill the disease-causing amebas. Moresevere cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treatedby replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame-bic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bedrest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat-ment can be complicated because different drugs may berequired to eliminate the parasite, based on the locationof the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame-biasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories:Luminal amebicidesThese drugs get their name because they act onorganisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel.They include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida-zole, and paromomycin.Tissue amebicidesTissue amebicides are used to treat infections in theliver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy-droemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Becausethese drugs have potentially serious side effects, patientsgiven emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest andheart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be themost useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess.Patients taking metronidazole must avoid alcoholbecause the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea,vomiting, and headache.KEY TERMS
Ameboma—A mass of tissue that can develop onthe wall of the colon in response to amebic infec-tion.Antibody—A specific protein produced by theimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.Appendicitis—Condition characterized by therapid inflammation of the appendix, a part of theintestine.Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease andare usually capable of transmitting the disease butwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease aresaid to be asymptomatic.Dysentery—Intestinal infection marked by diar-rhea containing blood and mucus.Fulminating colitis—A potentially fatal complica-tion of amebic dysentery marked by sudden andsevere inflammation of the intestinal lining, severebleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive sheddingof dead tissue.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—Disease inwhich the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.Lumen—The inner cavity or canal of a tube-shaped organ, such as the bowel.Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopicorganism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, differ-ent from bacteria (prokaryotic).Most patients are given a combination of luminal andtissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven to tendays. Follow-up care includes periodic stool examinationsbeginning two to four weeks after the end of medicationtreatment to check the effectiveness of drug therapy.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the location of the infectionand the patient’s general health prior to infection. The prog-nosis is generally good, although the mortality rate is high-er for patients with ameboma, perforation of the bowel, andliver infection. Patients who develop fulminant colitis havethe most serious prognosis, with over 50% mortality.
Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medica-tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-

Prevention requires effectivepersonal and community hygiene.Specific safeguards include the following:• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified byfiltering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.• Proper food handling. Measures include protectingfood from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom andbefore cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countrieswith high rates of amebiasis.• Careful disposal of human feces.• Monitoring the contacts of amebiasis patients. Thestools of family members and sexual partners of infect-ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts ortrophozoites.Resources

Amenorrhea
Definition
The absence of menstrual periods is called amenor-rhea. Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having aperiod by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is morecommon and refers to either the temporary or permanentending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-mally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-ly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or moreperiods in a row.
Description
The absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, nota disease. While the average age that menstruation beginsis 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-rhea in the United States is just 2.5%.Some female athletes who participate in rowing,long distance running, and cycling, may notice a fewmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk fordeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,who typically exercisestrenuously and eat poorly.
Causes and symptoms
Amenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-rhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-atric disorders, eating disorders,malnutrition, excessivethinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content toolow, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physicaltraining prior to pubertycan delay menarche (the onsetof menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-che for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induceamenorrhea.Primary amenorrheaHowever, the main cause is a delay in the beginningof puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity orpoor nutrition) or because of a problem in the endocrinesystem, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism. An obstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus maybe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,endocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.Typical causes of primary amenorrhea include:• excessive physical activity• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia orbulimia)• extreme obesity• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)• chronic illness• turner’s syndrome. (A chromosomal problem in placeat birth, relevant only in cases of primary amenorrhea)• the absence of a vagina or a uterus
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 146AmenorrheaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 146• imperforate hymen (lack of an opening to allow themenstrual blood through)Secondary amenorrheaSome of the causes of primary amenorrhea can alsocause secondary amenorrhea—strenuous physical activi-ty, excessive weight loss, use of antidepressants or tran-quilizers, in particular. In adolescents,pregnancyand stressare two major causes. Missed periods are usuallycaused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-ment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-ods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, orincreased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-sation of periods for four months should be evaluated.The most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea ispregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarilyafter she stops taking birth control pills. This temporaryhalt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in somecases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-rhea may also be related to hormonal problems related tostress, depression,anorexia nervosaor drugs, or it maybe caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as atumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-nently after menopauseor a hysterectomy.Polycystic ovary syndromeis another common causeof secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-ing many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels ofmale hormones (androgens). This condition is related toimproper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releaseshormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-mones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-tics, such as acneand coarse body hair. If the condition isnot treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,and chronically high levels of estrogen may increase thechance of developing cancerof the uterine lining.
Diagnosis
It may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,but the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-cy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period istwo to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogendeficiency, or other problems with the endocrine systemneed to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-roid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.The diagnosis usually includes a patient history anda physical exam (including a pelvic exam). If a womanhas missed three or more periods in a row, a physicianmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,a scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitarytumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis torule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.Treatment
Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-mary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’salways important to discover the cause of the problem inany case. Not all conditions can be treated, but anyunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated.If a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-terone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-rect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birthcontrol pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor istreated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certainhormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bringon a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessiveexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods inteen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be neededfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts.
Prognosis
Prolonged amenorrhea can lead to infertilityand other medical problems such as osteoporosis(thinning of thebones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stressor illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-es or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-continuing birth control pills usually go away within six toeight weeks, although it may take up to a year.The prognosis for polycystic ovary disease dependson the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.Spironolactone, a drug that blocks the production ofmale hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If awoman wishes to become pregnant, treatment withclomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,surgery on the ovaries.
Prevention
Primary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-tion cannot be prevented. In general, however, womenshould maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smokingand sub- stance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal-anced diet and rest and exercise normally. However,many cases of amenorrhea cannot be prevented.Resources

Amino acid disordersscreening
Definition
Amino acid disorder screening checks for inheriteddisorders in amino acid metabolism. Tests are most com-monly done on newborns. Two tests are available, oneusing a blood sample and the other a urine sample.
Purpose
Amino acid disorder screening is done in newborns,and sometimes children and adults, to detect inbornerrors in metabolism of amino acids. Twenty of the 100known amino acids are the main building blocks forhuman proteins. Proteins regulate every aspect of cellularKEY TERMS
Hymen—Membrane that stretches across theopening of the vagina.Hypothyroidism—Underactive thyroid gland.Hysterectomy—Surgical removal of the uterus.Turner’s syndrome—A condition in which onefemale sex chromosome is missing.function. Of these 20 amino acids, ten are not made bythe body and must be acquired through diet. Congenital(present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect aminoacid metabolism or congenital abnormalities in theamino acid transport system of the kidneys creates a con-dition called aminoaciduria.Screening is especially important in newborns.Some congenital amino acid metabolic defects causemental retardationthat can prevented with prompttreatment of the newborn. One of the best known exam-ples of this is phenylketonuria(PKU). This is an geneticerror in metabolism of phenylalanine, an amino acidfound in milk. Individuals with PKU do not produce theenzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine.PKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births inthe United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians andless prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans.Newborns in the United States are routinely screened forPKU by a blood test.There are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary oroverflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in theenzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids. Overflowaminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test.Secondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because ofa congenital defect in the amino acid transport system inthe tubules of the kidneys. This produces increasedamino acids in the urine. Blood and urine test in combi-nation are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is ofthe overflow or renal type. Urine tests are also used tomonitor specific amino acid disorders.Newborns are screened for amino acid disorders.Young children with acidosis (accumulation of acid inthe body), severe vomiting and diarrhea, or urine withan abnormal color or odor, are also screened with a urinetest for specific amino acid levels.
Precautions
Both blood and urine tests are simple tests that canbe done in a doctor’s office or clinic. These tests can bedone on even the youngest patients.
Description
Two types of amino acid screening tests are usedtogether to diagnose amino acid disorders.Blood plasma screeningIn the blood test, a medical technician draws a smallamount of blood from a baby’s heel. The procedure israpid and relatively painless. Total time for the test is lessthan ten minutes. The blood is sent to a laboratory whereresults will be available in about two days.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 148Amino acid disorders screeningGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 148Urine testIn the urine test, the patient is asked to urinate into acollecting cup. For an infant, the urine is collected in a pedi-atric urine collector. The process is painless. The length oftime the test takes is determined by how long it takes thepatient to urinate. Results also take about two days.Both these tests use thin layer chromatography toseparate the amino acids present. Using this technique,the amino acids form a characteristic patterns on a glassplate coated with a thin layer of silica gel. This pattern isthen compared to the normal pattern to determine if thereare abnormalities.
Preparation
Before the blood test, the patient must not eat ordrink for four hours. Failure to fast will alter the resultsof the test.The patient should eat and drink normally before theurine test. Some drugs may affect the results of the urinetest. The technician handling the urine sample should beinformed of any medications the patient is taking. Moth-ers of breastfeeding infants should report any medica-tions they are taking, since these can pass from mother tochild in breast milk.
Aftercare
The blood screening is normally done first. Depend-ing on the results, it is followed by the urine test. It takesboth tests to distinguish between overflow and renalaminoaciduria. Also, if the results are abnormal, a 24-hour urine test is performed along with other tests todetermine the levels of specific amino acids. In the eventof abnormal results, there are many other tests that willbe performed to determine the specific amino acidinvolved in the abnormality.
Risks
There are no particular risks associated with eitherof these tests. Occasionally minor bruising may occur atthe site where the blood was taken.
Normal results
The pattern of amino acid banding on the thin layerchromatography plates will be normal.
Abnormal results
The blood plasma amino acid pattern is abnormal inoverflow aminoaciduria and is normal in renalaminoaciduria. The pattern is abnormal in the urine test,suggesting additional tests need to be done to determineKEY TERMS

Aminoglycosides
Definition
Aminoglycosides are a group of antibioticsthat are used to treat certain bacterial infections. This group of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 149AminoglycosidesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 149antibiotics includes at least eight drugs: amikacin, gen-tamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, paro-momycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. All of thesedrugs have the same basic chemical structure.
Purpose
Aminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec-tions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte-ria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. InGram’s staining, a film of material containing the possiblebacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide isstained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off withwater and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodinesolution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed offand the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide isthen stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safraninefor 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega-tive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-fully be combated with aminoglycosides includePseudomonas,Acinetobacter, and Enterobacterspecies, among others. Aminoglycosides are also effective againstmycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis. The aminoglycosides can be used against certainGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employedbecause other antibiotics are more effective and havefewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffectiveagainst anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow inthe presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And onlyone aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-sitic infection.Like all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are noteffective against influenza, the common cold, or other viral infections.
Precautions
Pre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-ease, eighth cranial nerve disease,myasthenia gravis, and Parkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to takingany aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advisedagainst taking aminoglycosides, because their infants maysuffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-ance. However, those factors need to be considered along-side the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases ofserious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breastmilk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-scribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.
Description
Streptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolatedfrom Streptomyces griseusin the mid-1940s. This antibiot-ic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the maindrawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cellsin the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment withstreptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-siderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-tomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from thegastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-ly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished inquantity. The route of drug administration depends on thetype and location of the infection being treated. The typi-cal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-tion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection intoa vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.If the infection being treated involves the central nervoussystem, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.The bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has notbeen fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches toa bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-nels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.Ribosomes are the intracellular structures responsible formanufacturing proteins. This attachment either shutsdown protein production or causes the cell to produceabnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannotsurvive with this impediment.Antibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides maypair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually abeta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cellwall, making it more porous. The increased porosityallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.Traditionally, aminoglycosides were administered ateven doses given throughout the day. It was thought thata steady plasma concentration was necessary to combatinfection. However, this administration schedule is timeand labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a singledaily dose can be as effective, or more effective, thanseveral doses throughout the day.Dosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,and general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-neys, it is important to assess any underlying problemswith kidney function. Kidney function is assessed bymeasuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-mally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is anindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at anoptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.Risks
Aminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-tain cells in the ears and in the kidneys. Approximately 5-

However, in most cases the dam-age is minor and reversible once medication is stopped.If cells in the inner ear are damaged or destroyed, anindividual may experience a loss of balance and feelingsof dizziness. Damage to the middle ear may result inhearing lossor tinnitus. Neomycin, kanamycin, andamikacin are the most likely to cause problems withhearing, and streptomycin and gentamicin carry thegreatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance. Kid-ney damage, apparent with changes in urination frequen-cy or urine production, is most likely precipitated byneomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin.Young children and the elderly are at the greatestrisk of suffering side effects. Excessive dosage or poorclearance of the drug from the body can be injurious atany age.Less common side effects include skin rashesand itching. Very rarely, certain aminoglycosides may causedifficulty in breathing, weakness, or drowsiness. Gen-tamicin, when injected, may cause leg cramps, skin rash,fever, or seizures.If side effects linger or become worse after medica-tion is stopped, it is advisable to seek medical advice.Side effects that may be of concern include tinnitus orloss of hearing, dizziness or loss of balance, changes inurination frequency or urine production, increased thirst,appetite loss, and nausea or vomiting.
Normal results
At the proper dosage and in the presence of gram-negative enteric (intestinal) bacteria, aminoglycosidesare very effective in treating an infection.
Abnormal results
In some cases, bacteria are resistant to antibioticsthat would normally kill them. This resistance becomesapparent after repeated exposure to the antibiotic andarises from a mutation that alters the bacteria’s suscepti-bility to the drug. Various degrees of resistance have beenobserved in bacteria that normally would be destroyed byaminoglycosides. In general, though, aminoglycosideeffectiveness has held up well over time.Resources

Amnesia
Definition
Amnesia refers to the loss of memory. Memory lossmay result from two-sided (bilateral) damage to parts of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 151AmnesiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 151the brain vital for memory storage, processing, or recall(the limbic system, including the hippocampus in themedial temporal lobe).
Description
Amnesia can be a symptom of several neurodegen-erative diseases; however, people whose primary symp-tom is memory loss (amnesiacs), typically remain lucidand retain their sense of self. They may even be awarethat they suffer from a memory disorder.People who experience amnesia have been instrumen-tal in helping brain researchers determine how the brainprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s, researchersviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-ences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioningwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-cific area of the brain.If all memory were stored in the same way, it wouldbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brainarea would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-ies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such researchdemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-cessing, storing, and drawing on memory.
Causes and symptoms
Amnesia has several root causes. Most are traceableto brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-tion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow tothe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoffsyndrome, for example, damage to the memory centersof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-tion. Infections that damage brain tissue, includingencephalitisand herpes, can also cause amnesia. If theamnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it istermed psychogenic.There are at least three general types of amnesia:• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-ma and is characterized by the inability to remembernew information. Recent experiences and short-termmemory disappear, but victims can recall events priorto the trauma with clarity.• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is theopposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recallevents that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-ber previously familiar information or the events pre-ceding the trauma.• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has noconsistently identifiable cause, but researchers havesuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacksmay be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack, sometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when ablockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences suddenconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severeattacks, a person is completely disoriented and mayexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-al years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-sis for recovery.Diagnosis
In diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look atseveral factors. During a physical examination, the doc- tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug andmedication history, and checks the patient’s generalhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-mine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such asmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) to reveal whetherthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to excludetreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the root cause of amnesia andis handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause,cognitive rehabilitationmay be helpful in learningstrategies to cope with memory impairment.

Some types of amnesia, such as transient globalamnesia, are completely resolved and there is no perma-nent loss of memory. Others, such as Korsakoff syn-drome, associated with prolonged alcohol abuse oramnesias caused by severe brain injury, may be perma-nent. Depending on the degree of amnesia and its cause,victims may be able to lead relatively normal lives.Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on othermemory systems to compensate for what is lost.
Prevention
Amnesia is only preventable in so far as brain injurycan be prevented or minimized. Common sense approach-es include wearing a helmet when bicycling or participat-ing in potentially dangerous sports, using automobile seatbelts, and avoiding excessive alcohol or drug use. Braininfections should be treated swiftly and aggressively tominimize the damage due to swelling. Victims of strokes,brain aneurysms, and transient ischemic attacks shouldseek immediate medical treatment.Resources

Amniocentesis
Definition
Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose fetaldefects in the early second trimester of pregnancy. A sample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus inthe womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’sabdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed onfetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence ofmany types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctorsand prospective parents to make important decisionsabout early treatment and intervention.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 153AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 153Purpose
Since the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been usedroutinely to test for Down syndrome, by far the mostcommon, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflictingabout one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately800 different diagnostic tests were available, most ofthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachsdisease, sickle cell anemia,hemophilia,muscular dys-trophyand cystic fibrosis.Amniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommendedfor women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects, or when either of the parentshas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is toconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain otherdefects which may have shown up previously during rou-tine maternal blood screening.The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditarygenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greaterthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriagecaused by the procedure—aboutone in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.One of the most common reasons for performingamniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetusand present in the mother’s blood. A simple bloodscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week ofpregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’sblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signalpossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommendedwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.Amniocentesis is generally performed during the16th week of pregnancy, with results usually availablewithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio asearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-carriage when done at this time. The advantage of earlyamnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatmentof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the factthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial theearlier they are performed.
Precautions
As an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,although small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents mustweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, orindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small riskof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. Theserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse testresults can bring must also be considered. The decision toundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.
Description
The word amniocentesis literally means “punctureof the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which adeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. Duringthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a veryfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterusand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately oneounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-times using local anesthesia.The physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-dle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the womancan return home after a brief observation period. Shemay be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and toavoid heavy lifting for two days.The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratorywhere fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated andgrown in order to provide enough genetic material fortesting. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material isthen extracted and treated so that visual examination fordefects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound inthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill ofthe lab conducting them, all the results are availablebetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken.Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage forwomen over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternalblood screening results, and when genetic disorders runin the family.An alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori- onic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be performed asearly as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allowsfor the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant-ed, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 154AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 154The most promising area of new research in prenatal test-ing involves expanding the scope and accuracy of mater-nal blood screening as this poses no risk to the fetus.
Preparation
It is important for a woman to fully understand theprocedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician per-forming it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s experi-ence with the procedure reduces the chance of mishap.Almost all obstetricians are experienced in performingamniocentesis. The patient should feel free to ask ques-tions and seek emotional support before, during and afterthe amnio is performed.
Aftercare
Necessary aftercare falls into two categories, physi-cal and emotional.Physical aftercareDuring and immediately following the samplingprocedure, a woman may experience dizziness, nausea, arapid heartbeat, and cramping. Once past these immedi-ate hurdles, the physician will send the woman homewith instructions to rest and to report any complicationsrequiring immediate treatment, including:• vaginal bleeding. The appearance of blood could signala problem.•premature labor. Unusual abdominal painand/or cramping may indicate the onset of premature labor.Mild cramping for the first day or two following theprocedure is normal.• signs of infection. Leaking of amniotic fluid or unusualvaginal discharge, and fevercould signal the onset ofinfection.Emotional aftercareOnce the procedure has been safely completed, theanxietyof waiting for the test results can prove to be theworst part of the process. A woman should seek andreceive emotional support from family and friends, aswell as from her obstetrician and family doctor. Profes-sional counseling may also prove necessary, particularlyif a fetal defect is discovered.

Most of the risks and short-term side effects associ-ated with amniocentesis relate to the sampling procedureand have been discussed above. A successful amnio sam-pling results in no long-term side effects. Risks include:• maternal/fetal hemorrhaging. While spotting in preg-nancy is fairly common, bleeding following amnioshould always be investigated.• infection. Infection, although rare, can occur afteramniocentesis. An unchecked infection can lead tosevere complications.• fetal injury. A very slight risk of injury to the fetusresulting from contact with the amnio needle does exist.• miscarriage.

It is fatal.Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)—A procedure simi-lar to amniocentesis, except that cells are taken fromthe chorionic membrane for testing. These cells,called chorionic villus cells, eventually become theplacenta. The samples are collected either throughthe abdomen, as in amnio, or through the vagina.CVS can be done earlier in the pregnancy thanamnio, but carries a somewhat higher risk.Chromosome—Chromosomes are the strands ofgenetic material in a cell that occur in nearly identi-cal pairs.

Normal results
Negative results from an amnio analysis indicatethat everything about the fetus appears normal and thepregnancy can continue without undue concern. A nega-tive result for Down syndrome means that it is 99% cer-tain that the disease does not exist.An overall “normal” result does not, however, guar-antee that the pregnancy will come to term, or that thefetus does not suffer from some other defect. Laboratorytests are not 100% accurate at detecting targeted condi-tions, nor can every possible fetal condition be tested for.

Positive results on an amnio analysis indicate thepresence of the fetal defect being tested for, with anaccuracy approaching 100%. Prospective parents arethen faced with emotionally and ethically difficult choic-es regarding treatment options, the prospect of dealingwith a severely affected newborn, and the option of elec-tive abortion. At this point, the parents need expert med-ical advice and counseling.Resources

Amputation
Definition
Amputation is the intentional surgical removal of alimb or body part. It is performed to remove diseased tis-sue or relieve pain.
Purpose
Arms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can all beamputated. Most amputations involve small body partssuch as a finger, rather than an entire limb. About 65,000amputations are performed in the United States each year.Amputation is performed for the following reasons:• to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate bloodsupply• to remove malignant tumors• because of severe trauma to the body partThe blood supply to an extremity can be cut offbecause of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of thearteries,arterial embolism, impaired circulation as acomplication of diabetes mellitus, repeated severe infec-tion that leads to gangrene, severe frostbite,Raynaud’sdisease, or Buerger’s disease.More than 90% of amputations performed in theUnited States are due to circulatory complications of dia-betes. Sixty to eighty percent of these operations involvethe legs.
Precautions
Amputations cannot be performed on patients withuncontrolled diabetes mellitus,heart failure, or infec-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 157AmputationGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 157tion. Patients with blood clotting disorders are also notgood candidates for amputation.
Description
Amputations can be either planned or emergencyprocedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the mainreasons for emergency amputations. The operation isperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-eral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.Details of the operation vary slightly depending onwhat part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations istwofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound willheal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow theattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.The surgeon makes an incision around the part to beamputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.A flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, andskin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closedover the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remainin place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing orcast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.Preparation
Before an amputation is performed, extensive testingis done to determine the proper level of amputation. Thegoal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing ismost likely to be complete, while allowing the maximumamount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation. The greater the blood flow through an area, the morelikely healing is to occur. These tests are designed to mea-sure blood flow through the limb. Several or all of themcan be done to help choose the proper level of amputation.• measurement of blood pressure in different parts of thelimb• xenon 133 studies, which use a radiopharmaceutical tomeasure blood flow• oxygen tension measurements in which an oxygen elec-trode is used to measure oxygen pressure under the skin

Aftercare
After amputation, medication is prescribed for pain,and patients are treated with antibioticsto discourageinfection. The stump is moved often to encourage goodcirculation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are startedas soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies haveshown that there is a positive relationship between earlyrehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump andprosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on theseverity of the amputation and the general health of theamputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks.Rehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especiallyfor above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera-py is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel-ing is an important part of rehabilitation. Many peoplefeel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body part.Others are bothered by phantom limb syndrome, wherethey feel as if the amputated part is still in place. Theymay even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Manyamputees benefit from joining self-help groups andmeeting others who are also living with amputation.Addressing the emotional aspects of amputation oftenspeeds the physical rehabilitation process.
Risks
Amputation is major surgery. All the risks associatedwith the administration of anesthesia exist, along withthe possibility of heavy blood loss and the developmentof blood clots. Infection is of special concern toamputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. Ifthe stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove theprosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at ahigher level.Failure of the stump to heal is another major compli-cation. Nonhealing is usually due to an inadequate bloodsupply. The rate of nonhealing varies from 5-30%KEY TERMS

Its cause is unknown.depending on the facility. Centers that specialize in ampu-tation usually have the lowest rates of complication.Persistent pain in the stump or pain in the phantomlimb is experienced by most amputees to some degree.Treatment of phantom limb pain is difficult. One finalcomplication is that many amputees give up on the reha-bilitation process and discard their prosthesis. Better fit-ting prosthetics and earlier rehabilitation have decreasedthe incidence of this problem.
Normal results
The five year survival rate for all lower extremityamputees is less than 50%. For diabetic amputees, therate is less than 40%. Up to 50% of people who haveone leg amputated because of diabetes will lose theother within five years. Amputees who walk using aprosthesis have a less stable gait. Three to five percentof these people fall and break bones because of thisinstability. Although the fracturescan be treated, abouthalf the amputees who suffer them then remain wheel-chair bound.Resources

Definition
Amylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily bythe pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are sub-stances made and used by the body to trigger specificchemical reactions. The primary function of the enzymeamylase is to break down starches in food so that theycan be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually doneto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain.
Purpose
Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a numberof diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for example, is the most common reason for a high amylaselevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapesfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hoursafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start torise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-ally returning to normal.There are other causes of increased amylase. Anulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes intothe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.During a mumpsinfection, amylase from the inflamedsalivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in theliver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation ofthese tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning, ruptured aortic aneurysm, and intestinal strangulation or perfora-tion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-ease.
Description
Amylase testing is done on both blood and urine.The laboratory may use any of several testing methodsthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-stance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-ing the end-product or the reaction time, technicians cancalculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.More sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-lase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by thesalivary glands.Urine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-lase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylasefrom the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10hours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine isusually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.Results are usually available the same day.
Preparation
In most cases, no special preparation is necessary fora person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients takinglonger term urine amylase tests will be given a containerand instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urineshould be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture siteor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-ing warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and themethod used.
Abnormal results
Eight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis willhave high amylase levels, up to four times the normallevel. Other causes of increased amylase, such asmumps, kidney failure,pregnancyoccurring in theabdomen but outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), certain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complicationsof diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer, are furtherinvestigated based on the person’s symptoms, medicalhistory, and the results of other tests.In kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient atremoving amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in theblood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.People with macroamylasia have large clumps ofamylase in their blood. These clumps are too large tomove through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-lase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urinewill be low.Amylase levels may be low in severe liver disease(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreasfails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build upin the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), followingburns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic fibrosis. Some medications can raise or lower levels.Resources

Amyloidosis
Definition
Amyloidosis is a progressive, incurable, metabolicdisease characterized by abnormal deposits of protein inone or more organs or body systems.
Description
Amyloid proteins are manufactured by malfunction-ing bone marrow. Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu-mulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function,can cause organ failure or death. It is a rare disease,occurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. Itaffects males and females equally and usually developsafter the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis havebeen identified. Each one is associated with deposits of adifferent kind of protein.Types of amyloidosisThe major forms of this disease are primary sys-temic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis.There is also another form of amyloidosis associatedwith Alzheimer’s disease.Primary systemic amyloidosis usually developsbetween the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 newcases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosisKEY TERMS
Amylase—A digestive enzyme made primarily bythe pancreas and salivary glands.Enzyme—A substance made and used by the bodyto trigger specific chemical reactions.Pancreatitis—Inflammation of the pancreas.is the most common form of this disease in the UnitedStates. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, itmay also occur in association with multiple myeloma(bone marrow cancer).Secondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-tion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:•familial Mediterranean fever(a bacterial infectioncharacterized by chills, weakness,headache, and recurring fever)• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-tine)• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)• leprosy• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bonemarrow)• rheumatoid arthritisFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-ited form of the disease. It occurs in members of mostethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive patternof symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-dosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which meansthat only one copy of the defective gene is necessary tocause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-loidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.Amyloidosis can involve any organ or system in thebody. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, andnervous system are affected most often. Other commonsites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints,liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most patientshave gastrointestinal abnormalities, but other symptomsvary according to the organ(s) or system(s) affected bythe disease. Usually the affected organs are rubbery, firm,and enlarged.HeartBecause amyloid protein deposits can limit theheart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even theslightest exertion can cause shortness of breath. If the heart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s rhythmmay become erratic. The heart may also be enlarged andheart murmursmay be present. Congestive heart fail-uremay result.KidneysThe feet, ankles, and calves swell when amyloidosisdamages the kidneys. The kidneys become small and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 161AmyloidosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 161hard, and kidney failure may result. It is not unusual for apatient to lose 20-25 pounds and develop a distaste formeat, eggs, and other protein-rich foods. Cholesterol ele-vations that don’t respond to medication and protein inthe urine (proteinuria) are common.Nervous systemNervous system symptoms often appear in patientswith familial amyloidosis. Inflammation and degenera-tion of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) may be present. One of four patients with amyloidosishas carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful disorder thatcauses numbness or tingling in response to pressure onnerves around the wrist. Amyloidosis that affects nervesto the feet can cause burning or numbness in the toes andsoles and eventually weaken the legs. If nerves control-ling bowel function are involved, bouts of diarrhea alternate with periods of constipation. If the diseaseaffects nerves that regulate blood pressure, patients mayfeel dizzy or faint when they stand up suddenly.Liver and spleenThe most common symptoms are enlargement ofthese organs. Liver function is not usually affected untilquite late in the course of the disease. Protein accumula-tion in the spleen can increase the risk of rupture of thisorgan due to trauma.Gastrointestinal systemThe tongue may be inflammed, enlarged, and stiff.Intestinal movement (motility) may be reduced. Absorp-tion of food and other nutrients may be impaired (andmay lead to malnutrition), and there may also be bleed-ing, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.SkinSkin symptoms occur in about half of all cases ofprimary and secondary amyloidosis and in all caseswhere there is inflammation or degeneration of theperipheral nerves. Waxy-looking raised bumps (papules)KEY TERMS
Amyloid—A waxy, starch-like protein.Peripheral nerves—Nerves that carry informationto and from the spinal cord.Stem cells—Parent cells from which other cells aremade.may appear on the face and neck, in the groin, armpits, oranal area, and on the tongue or in the ear canals.Swelling, hemorrhage beneath the skin (purpura), hairloss, and dry mouthmay also occur.Respiratory systemAirways may be obstructed by amyloid deposits inthe nasal sinus, larynx and traches (windpipe).
Diagnosis
Blood and urine tests can reveal the presence ofamyloid protein, but tissue or bone-marrow biopsy isnecessary to positively diagnose amyloidosis. Once thediagnosis has been confirmed, additional laboratory testsand imaging procedures are performed to determine:• which type of amyloid protein is involved• which organ(s) or system(s) have been affected• how far the disease has progressed
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to slow down or stop pro-duction of amyloid protein, eliminate existing amyloiddeposits, alleviate underlying disorders (that give rise tosecondary amyloidosis), and relieve symptoms caused byheart or kidney damage. Specialists in cardiology, hema-tology (the study of blood and the tissues that form it),nephrology (the study of kidney function and abnormali-ties), neurology (the study of the nervous system), andrheumatology (the study of disorders characterized byinflammation or degeneration of connective tissue) worktogether to assess a patient’s medical status and evaluatethe effects of amyloidosis on every part of the body.Colchicine (Colebenemid, Probeneaid), prednisone,(Prodium), and other anti-inflammatory drugs can slowor stop disease progression. Bone-marrow and stem-celltransplants can enable patients to tolerate higher andmore effective doses of melphalan (Alkeran) and otherchemotherapydrugs prescribed to combat this non-malignant disease. Surgery can relieve nerve pressureand may be performed to correct other symptom-produc-ing conditions. Localized amyloid deposits can also beremoved surgically. Dialysis or kidney transplantationcan lengthen and improve the quality of life for patientswhose amyloidosis results in kidney failure. Heart trans-plants are rarely performed.Supportive measuresAlthough no link has been established between dietand development of amyloid proteins, a patient whoseheart or kidneys have been affected by the disease maybe advised to use a diuretic or follow a low-salt diet.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 162AmyloidosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 162Prognosis
Most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed after thedisease has reached an advanced stage. The course ofeach patient’s illness is unique but death, usually a resultof heart disease or kidney failure, generally occurs withina few years. Amyloidosis associated by multiple myelo-ma usually has a poor prognosis. Most patients with bothdiseases die within one to two years.
Prevention
Genetic counselingmay be helpful for patients withhereditary amyloidosis and their families. Use ofcholchicine in patients with familial Mediterranean feverhas successfully prevented amyloidosis.Resources

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Definition
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease thatbreaks down tissues in the nervous system (a neurode-generative disease) of unknown cause that affects thenerves responsible for movement. It is also known asmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after thebaseball player whose career it ended.
Description
ALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nervecells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (uppermotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheralnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-ment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,leading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-ly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and ofitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, theheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-tem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people withALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-er, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss ofintellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, acardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of theregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”describes the hardened tissue that develops in place ofhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 peoplein the United States, with about 5,000 new cases eachyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,although younger onset is possible. Men are slightlymore likely to develop ALS than women.ALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatalwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, andwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people withALS live beyond eight years.
Causes and symptoms
CausesThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the deathof motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, theseneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to themuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,neck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles theyenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weaknessresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to musclewasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motorneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, andabnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neuronscauses muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).Although many causes of motor neuron degenera-tion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet beenproven responsible. Results of recent research haveimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-cals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of eventsleads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-rons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should beproduced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether thisexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerativeprocesses. Additional agents within this toxic cascademay include excessive levels of a neurotransmitterknown as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motorneurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, anda faulty detoxificationenzyme known as SOD-1, for

The actual pathway ofdestruction is not known, however, nor is the trigger forthe rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further researchmay show that other pathways are involved, perhaps oneseven more important than this one. Autoimmune factorsor premature agingmay play some role, as could viralagents or environmental toxins.Two major forms of ALS are known: familial andsporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALScases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to becaused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes.About 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta-tions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom-inant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to developthe disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a50% chance of passing the gene along to a child.Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While manyenvironmental toxins have been suggested as causes, todate no research has confirmed any of the candidatesinvestigated, including aluminum and mercury and leadfrom dental fillings. As research progresses, it is likelythat many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have agenetic basis as well.A third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs inGuam and other Pacific islands. This form combinessymptoms of both ALS and Parkinson’s disease.SymptomsThe earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness inthe arms or legs, usually more pronounced on one sidethan the other at first. Loss of function is usually more

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the degeneration and death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain.These neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,neck, and head. As motor neurons degenerate, the muscles are weakened and cannot move as effectively, leading to musclewasting.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 164rapid in the legs among people with familial ALS and inthe arms among those with sporadic ALS. Leg weaknessmay first become apparent by an increased frequency ofstumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-culty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-ty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss ofdexterity in the fingers.Less often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness inthe bulbarmuscles, those muscles in the mouth andthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Aperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tiredafter speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.In addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs ofALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-ulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomesobvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people withoutthe disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.While initial weakness may be limited to one region,ALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtuallyall the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-toms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms andhands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold thehead up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makesbreathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-trol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-ration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-tion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilatorand scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS maylive much longer than the average, although weakness andwasting will continue to erode any remaining functionalabilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain functionof the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowingsome communication to take place with simple blinks orthrough use of a computer-assisted device.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-ical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-ination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-ness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-tromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-nostic process. Various other tests, including blood andurine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule outother possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors ofthe skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-ease, spinal arthritis,lead poisoning, or severe vitamindeficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care-ful review of all these factors.
Treatment
There is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that cansignificantly alter its course. There are many thingsKEY TERMS
Aspiration—Inhalation of food or liquids into thelungs.Bulbar muscles—Muscles of the mouth and throatresponsible for speech and swallowing.Fasciculations—Involuntary twitching of muscles.Motor neuron—A nerve cell that controls a mus-cle.Riluzole (Rilutek)—The first drug approved in theUnited States for the treatment of ALS.Voluntary muscle—A muscle under consciouscontrol; contrasted with smooth muscle and heartmuscle which are not under voluntary control.which can be done, however, to help maintain quality oflife and to retain functional ability even in the face ofprogressive weakness.As of early 1998, only one drug had been approvedfor treatment of ALS. Riluzole (Rilutek) appears to pro-vide on average a three-month increase in life expectancywhen taken regularly early in the disease, and shows asignificant slowing of the loss of muscle strength. Rilu-zole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve ter-minals. Experimental trials of nerve growth factor havenot demonstrated any benefit. No other drug or vitamincurrently available has been shown to have any effect onthe course of ALS.A physical therapist works with an affected personand family to implement exerciseand stretching pro-grams to maintain strength and range of motion, and topromote general health. Swimming may be a goodchoice for people with ALS, as it provides a low-impactworkout to most muscle groups. One result of chronicinactivity is contracture, or muscle shortening. Contrac- tureslimit a person’s range of motion, and are oftenpainful. Regular stretching can prevent contracture. Sev-eral drugs are available to reduce cramping, a commoncomplaint in ALS.An occupational therapist can help design solutionsto movement and coordination problems, and provideadvice on adaptive devices and home modifications.Speech and swallowing difficulties can be mini-mized or delayed through training provided by a speech-language pathologist. This specialist can also provideadvice on communication aids, including computer-assisted devices and simpler word boards.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 165Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 165Nutritional advice can be provided by a nutritionist.A person with ALS often needs softer foods to preventjaw exhaustion or choking. Later in the disease,nutri- tionmay be provided by a gastrostomytube insertedinto the stomach.Mechanical ventilation may be used when breathingbecomes too difficult. Modern mechanical ventilators aresmall and portable, allowing a person with ALS to main-tain the maximum level of function and mobility. Ventila-tion may be administered through a mouth or nose piece,or through a tracheostomy tube. This tube is insertedthrough a small hole made in the windpipe. In addition toproviding direct access to the airway, the tube alsodecreases the risk aspiration. While many people withrapidly progressing ALS choose not to use ventilators forlengthy periods, they are increasingly being used to pro-long life for a short time.The progressive nature of ALS means that most per-sons will eventually require full-time nursing care. Thiscare is often provided by a spouse or other family mem-ber. While the skills involved are not difficult to learn,the physical and emotional burden of care can be over-whelming. Caregivers need to recognize and provide fortheir own needs as well as those of people with ALS, toprevent depression, burnout, and bitterness.Throughout the disease, a support group can provideimportant psychological aid to affected persons and theircaregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALSinflicts. Support groups are sponsored by both the ALSSociety and the Muscular DystrophyAssociation.
Alternative treatment
Given the grave prognosis and absence of tradition-al medical treatments, it is not surprising that a largenumber of alternative treatments have been tried forALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested thatamino-acid therapies may provide some improvementfor some people with ALS. While individual reportsclaim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi-cine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi-dence suggests that these offer any more than a briefpsychological boost, often followed by a more severeletdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con-tinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS arebetter understood, alternative therapies may be moreintensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi-cals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,antioxidant vitaminsand supplements may be usedmore routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, ifenvironmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera-pies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be ofsome use.Prognosis
ALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to deathfrom respiratory infection within three to five years inmost cases. The slowest disease progression is seen inthose who are young and have their first symptoms in thelimbs. About 10% of people with ALS live longer thaneight years.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent ALS or to alter itscourse.Resources

Anaerobic infections
Definition
An anaerobic infection is an infection caused bybacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in thepresence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deepwounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where there islittle oxygen. These infections are characterized byabscessformation, foul-smelling pus, and tissuedestruction.
Description
Anaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-teria grow in places which completely, or almost com-pletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in themouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteriainclude gas gangrene,tetanus, and botulism. Nearly alldental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when anormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,the immune system kills any invading bacteria, butsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause aninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygenand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The lowoxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,shock, injury, and surgery.Anaerobic bacteria can cause infection practicallyanywhere in the body. For example:• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the rootcanals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,and ears.• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia, lung abscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung ( empye- ma), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis). • Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within theabdomen include abscess formation,peritonitis, and appendicitis.• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can causepelvic abscesses,pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), andpelvic infections following abortion,childbirth, and surgery.• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are commoncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructiveinfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-tis), and bite wound infections.• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can causebrain and spinal cord abscesses.• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in thebloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-teremia).
Causes and symptoms
People who have experienced shock, injury, orsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumorsare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-ria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteriawhich can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobicinfections are “mixed infections” which means thatthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing. Theanaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infectionsare Bacteroides fragilis,Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridiumspecies.The signs and symptoms of anaerobic infectioncan vary depending on the location of the infection. Ingeneral, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruc-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 167Anaerobic infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 167tion, an abscess which drains foul-smelling pus, andpossibly fever. Symptoms for specific infections areas follows:• Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleedinggums,bad breath, and pain. Severe infections mayproduce oozing sores.• Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad breath,a bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense of choking. • Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breath-ing, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.• Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-lowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood drainingfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,and chills.• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,painful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drainsfoul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may causeextensive tissue destruction (necrosis).• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, andis potentially fatal.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-marily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, andlocation of the infection. A foul-smelling infection ordrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobicinfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-teria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late inthe infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection includetissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. Asample from the infected site may be obtained, using aswab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-ria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteriacan be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in thelaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.KEY TERMS
Abscess—A lump filled with pus resulting from aninfection.Anaerobic—Living and growing in the absence ofoxygen.Necrosis—Tissue death and destruction resultingfrom infection or disease.The recent medical history of the patient is helpfulin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has orrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vesseldisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. Thefailure to improve following treatment with antibioticsthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that theinfection is caused by anaerobes. The location and typeof infection also help in the diagnosis.Diagnostic tests may include blood tests to see ifbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look atinternal infections.
Treatment
Serious infections may require hospitalization fortreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobicinfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identifythe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-otic will work best. Every antibiotic does not workagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes arekilled by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-zole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).Other antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).Surgical removal or drainage of the abscess isalmost always required. This may involve drainage byneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior tothe aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscessescan be drained using this procedure with the help ofultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualizeinternal organs). This type of abscess drainage may beperformed in the doctor’s office.
Prognosis
Complete recovery should be achieved with theappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreatedor uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue andbone destruction, which would require plastic surgery torepair. Serious infections can be life threatening.
Prevention
Although anaerobic infections can occur in anyone,good hygiene and general health may help to preventinfections.Resources

Anal atresia
Definition
The anus is either not present or it is in the wrongplace.
Description
There are basically two kinds of anal atresia. In boyswith high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula)connecting the large intestine to either the urethra (whichdelivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. Ingirls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixtypercent of children with high anal atresia have otherdefects, including problems with the esophagus, urinarytract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel mayopen in front of the circular mass of muscles that con-strict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, inboys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine endsjust under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali-ties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.A mother who has one child with these kind of condi-tions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-fers from this ailment.
Cause and symptoms
Anal atresia is a defect in the development of thefetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play aminor role.
Diagnosis
Usually a physician can make an obvious visualdiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed andsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of thefirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-iting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-sia and the exact position, x rays will be taken whichinclude injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) or computed tomographyscans(CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-niques used to determine the type and size of the analatresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass xrays through the body at different angles, and an MRIuses a magnetic field and radio waves.KEY TERMS
Anus—The canal at the end of the large intestinethrough which waste is excreted to the outside ofthe body.Bowel obstruction—Anything that prevents wastefrom moving normally to the anal opening.Colostomy—An operation where the large intes-tine is diverted through an opening in theabdomen and waste is excreted.Feces—Bodily waste material that normally passesthrough the anus.Fistula—An abnormal channel that connects twoorgans or connects an organ to the skin.
Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. Forhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,a surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make atemporary opening (colostomy) in the abdomen wherewaste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine ismoved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part ofthe anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy isclosed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-ly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open thearea where the anus should be. If the channel is in thewrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-tion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,the pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate orwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do thisdaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.
Prognosis
With high anal atresia, many children have problemscontrolling bowel function. Most also become constipat-ed. With low anal atresia, children generally have goodbowel control, but they may still become constipated.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent anal atresia.Resources

Definition
Anal canceris an uncommon form of cancer affect-ing the anus. The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long endportion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solidwastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestineinclude the colon and the rectum.
Description
Different cancers can develop in different parts ofthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part ofwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of theanus are harmless in their early stages but may laterdevelop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example, con-tain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.Types of anal cancer include:• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half ofanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arisefrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.The anal margin is the part of the anus that is half insideand half outside the body, and the anal canal is the partof the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form ofsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma insitu, or Bowen’s disease.• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth toone-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.These tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-ca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal andthe rectum.• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-nocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. Onetype of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal areais called Paget’s disease, which can also affect thevulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers areeither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, whichdevelop from skin cells that produce the brown pigmentcalled melanin, are far more common on areas of thebody exposed to the sun.Approximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosedwith anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-als will die of the disease during this same interval,according to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancersare fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancersaffecting the digestive system. The disease affectswomen somewhat more often than men, although thenumber of cases among men, particularly homosexualmen, seems to be increasing.Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,although certain individuals appear to have a higher riskof developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, asare individuals with certain types of the human papillo-mavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems inthe anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-las. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-tice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of analcancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex areabout 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-erosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,such individuals with HIV, or transplant patients takingimmunosuppressant drugs, are also at higher risk.Most individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.Symptoms of anal cancer resemble those found inother harmless conditions. They include pain,itching and bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of thestool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodesin the anal or groin area.
Diagnosis
Anal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routinephysicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoidremoval. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal examination(DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,lubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.Individuals over the age of 50 who have no symptomsshould have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  fiveto 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)guidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.Other diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:Anoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a specialdevice to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure thatinvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-srectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves areused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.A biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;that is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under amicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-form a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymphnodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancerhasn’t spread to these nodes.Anal cancer severity is categorized by the followingstages:• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer ofanal tissue.• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer ofanal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 170Anal cancerGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170• Stage II anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer ofanal tissue and is larger than 1 inch in diameter, but hasnot spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.• Stage IIIA anal cancer has spread to the lymph nodesaround the rectum or to nearby organs such as the vagi-na or bladder.• Stage IIIB anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes in themid-abdomen or groin, or to nearby organs and thelymph nodes around the rectum.• Stage IV anal cancer has spread to distant lymph nodeswithin the abdomen or to distant organs.
Treatment
Anal cancer is treated using three methods, usedeither in concert or individually: surgery,radiation ther-apy, and chemotherapy.Two types of surgery may be performed. A localresection, performed if the cancer has not spread,removes the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor.An abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce-dure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed,and an opening called a colostomyis created for bodywastes to exit. This procedure is fairly uncommon todaybecause radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective.Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to fightcancer cells. It is usually delivered via a machine outsidethe body, but may also be delivered via surgicallyimplanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is calledinternal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation.Side effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam-age resembling sunburn, and damage to anal tissues.Chemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which maybe delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy typeskill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly bymaking cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. Themain drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects ofchemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition tocancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite,diarrhea, mouth sores,fatigue, shortness of breath, and a weakened immune system.
Alternative treatment
Research suggests acupuncturecan help managechemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and controlpain associated with surgery.
Prognosis
Anal cancer is often curable. The chance of recoverydepends on the cancer stage and the patient’s general health.KEY TERMS
Biopsy—A procedure in which a small piece ofbody tissue is removed and examined under amicroscope for cancer.Chemotherapy—A cancer treatment in whichdrugs delivered into the blood stream kill cancercells or make them more vulnerable to radiationtherapy.Human papillomavirus (HPV)—A virus with manysubtypes, some of which cause cell changes thatincrease the risk of certain cancers.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—The virusthat causes acquired immune deficiency syn-drome (AIDS).Lymph nodes—Bean-shaped structures foundthroughout the body that produce and store infec-tion-fighting cells.Radiation therapy—A cancer treatment that useshigh-energy rays to kill or weaken cancer cells.Radiation may be delivered externally or internal-ly via surgically implanted pellets.
Prevention
Reducing the risks of the sexually transmitted dis-easesHPV and HIV also reduces the risk of anal cancer. Inaddition, quitting smokinglowers the risk of anal cancer.Resources

Anal warts
Definition
Anal warts, also known as condyloma acuminata,are small warts that can occur in the rectum.
Description
Initially appear as tiny blemishes that can be assmall as the head of a pin or grow into larger cauliflower-like protuberances. They can be yellow, pink, or lightbrown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-able. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware thatthey exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.Most individuals have between one to 10 genital wartsthtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm
2. Some will complain of painless bumps or itching, but often,these warts can remain completely unnoticed.
Causes and symptoms
Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most commonsexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.Risk factors include smoking, using oral contracep-tives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early coitalage. In addition, individuals who have a history ofimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.Roughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by thehuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which arethe least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-cerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through directsexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-loma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, includingthe penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-one infected with condyloma acuminata will developthese warts within three months.
Treatment
According to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-ease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,including anal warts, should be conducted according tothe methods preferred by the patient, the medications orprocedures most readily available, and the experience ofthe patient’s physician in removing anal warts.Treatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-cal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the analcanal will almost always be treated with cauterization orsurgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-sion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrencerates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure ratesrange from 63–91%.Unfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-ments because the virus that causes the warts can live inthe surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal andwart-free for six months or longer before another wartdevelops.Laser surgeryis another possibility, but requireslocal, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on thenumber warts and where they are.Electrocoagulation, a technique that uses electricalenergy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful ofthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminataof the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It isdone with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge orbleeding from the anus.Follow-up visits to the physician are necessary tomake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-mended that these patients see their physicians everythree to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how longthe incubation period is for the HPV virus.Carbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-tion are other options, but these are usually reserved forextensive warts or those that continue to recur despitenumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus canbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,they are usually reserved for the worst infections.For small warts that affect only the skin around theanus, several medications are available, which can beapplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physicianor by the patients themselves.Such medications include podophyllum resin(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from thecytotoxic extracts of several plants. This agent offers a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 172Anal wartsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 172cure rate of 20–50% when used alone, and is applied bythe physician weekly and then washed off 6 hours laterby the patient.Podofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is avail-able for patients to use at home. It can be applied twicedaily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly highercure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre-vent warts.Trichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-able in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-ment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau-terize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, theycause less irritation and overall body effects than theother agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, ishigher with these acids.Bleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option,but it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis-tered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but iscan have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol-lowed carefully by their physician.Imiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients toapply themselves. It is to be applied three times weekly,for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to clear wartswithin eight to 10 weeks.Finally, the interferon drugs, which are naturallyoccurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumoreffects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2aand 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected intoeach lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks.
Prognosis
Once a diagnosis of anal warts has been made, fur-ther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes preventedwith proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of anal wartseither fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients haveto undergo roughly six to nine treatments over severalmonths to assure that the warts are completely eradicated.Recurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50%after one year and may be due to the long incubation ofHPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.
Prevention
Sexual abstinence and monogamous relationships canbe the most effective form of prevention, and condomsmay also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo-ma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual relations with peo-ple who have anal or genital warts can prevent infection.Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware thatthey have this condition, this is not always possible.KEY TERMS
Electrocoagulation—a technique using electricalenergy to destroy the warts. Usually done for wartswithin the anus with a local anesthesia, electroco-agulation is most painful form of therapy, and cancause both bleeding and discharge from the anus.Individuals infected with anal warts should have fol-low-up checkups every few weeks after their initial treat-ment, after which self-exams can be done.Sexual partners of people who have anal wartsshould also be examined, as a precautionary preventivemeasure.Finally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex)may be useful to prevent recurrence once the warts havebeen removed. Treatment must, however, be initiatedwithin 1 month of wart removal.Resources

Analgesics
Definition
Analgesics are medicines that relieve pain.
Purpose
Analgesics are those drugs whose primary purposeis pain relief. The primary classes of analgesics are thenarcotics, including additional agents that are chemically
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 173AnalgesicsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 173based on the morphine molecule but have minimal abusepotential; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) including the salicylates; andacetaminophen. Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-depressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,have been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologicpain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-gesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect oncausation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue oftheir dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.
Description
Pain has been classified as “productive” pain and“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has nophysiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-ment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warningof injury, and so may be both an indication of need fortreatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”pain by definition serves no purpose either as a warningor diagnostic tool.Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar, thecommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affectedorgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of thenerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheralnervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by thecentral nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-gesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factorsof each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity ofpain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain hasbeen divided into two classes, acute and chronic,although severity and projected patient survival are otherfactors that must be considered in drug selection.Acute painAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and includespost-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth. Because pain of these types is expected to be short term,the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-tinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely betreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for theiraddictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concernfor their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should beadjusted based on observation of healing rate, switchingpatients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-gesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.An important consideration of pain managementin severe pain is that patients should not be subject to thereturn of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately toassure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequentlyenough to avoid the anxietythat accompanies the antici-pated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed ona “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered oftenenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. Thisapplies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.Chronic painChronic pain, pain lasting over three months andsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult totreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesicsare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-gesics this means the addictionpotential, as well as res-piratory depression and constipation. For the NSAIDs,the risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. Whilesome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-onist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-coxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,they are still not fully suitable for long-term managementof severe pain. Generally, chronic pain managementrequires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-cation, and other treatment modalities.Narcotic analgesicsThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are allderived from opium. The class includes morphine,codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics includingmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-ers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all areeffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-quate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Becausethese drugs are all addictive, they are controlled underfederal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms areavailable, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous andintrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, areeffective analgesics even at doses too low to have anyanti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-cal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects andside effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-tration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate forinjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain forshort periods.Acetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with noanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild tomoderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-mal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.Because acetaminophen is largely free of side effects attherapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choicefor mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis.
Recommended dosage
Appropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-sider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 174AnalgesicsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174with patient age and condition. For example, narcoticanalgesics should usually be avoided in patients with ahistory of substance abuse, but may be fully appropriatein patients with cancerpain. Similarly, because narcoticsare more rapidly metabolized in patients who have usedthese drugs for a long period, higher than normal dosesmay be needed to provide adequate pain management.NSAIDs, although comparatively safe in adults, repre-sent an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding inpatients over the age of 60.
Precautions
Narcotic analgesics may be contraindicated inpatients with respiratory depression. NSAIDS may behazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer history.They should be used with care in patients with renalinsufficiency or coagulation disorders. NSAIDs arecontraindicated in patients allergic to aspirin.
Side effects
Review adverse effects of each drug individually.Drugs within a class may vary in their frequency andseverity of adverse effects.The primary adverse effects of the narcotic anal-gesics are addiction, constipation, and respiratorydepression. Because narcotic analgesics stimulate theproduction of enzymes that cause the metabolism ofthese drugs, patients on narcotics for a prolonged periodmay require increasing doses. This is not the same thingas addiction, and is not a reason for withholding medica-tion from patients in severe pain.NSAIDs are ulcerogenic and may cause kidneyproblems. Gastrointestinal discomfort is common,although in some cases, these drugs may cause ulcersKEY TERMS

Analgesics, opioid
Definition
Opioid analgesics, also known as narcotic anal-gesics, are painrelievers that act on the central nervoussystem. Like all narcotics, they may become habit-form-ing if used over long periods.
Purpose
Opioid analgesics are used to relieve pain from avariety of conditions. Some are used before or duringsurgery (including dental surgery) both to relieve pain andto make anesthetics work more effectively. They may alsobe used for the same purposes during labor and delivery.
Description
Opioid analgesics relieve pain by acting directly onthe central nervous system. However, this can also leadto unwanted side effects, such as drowsiness,dizziness, breathing problems, and physical or mental dependence.Among the drugs in this category are codeine, pro-poxyphene (Darvon), propoxyphene and acetaminophen(Darvocet N), meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone(Dilaudid), morphine, oxycodone, oxycodone and aceta-minophen (Percocet, Roxicet), and hydrocodone andacetaminophen (Lortab, Anexsia). These drugs come inmany forms—tablets, syrups, suppositories, and injec-tions, and are sold only by prescription. For some, a newprescription is required for each new supply—refills areprohibited according to federal regulations.
Recommended dosage
Recommended doses vary, depending on the type ofopioid analgesic and the form in which it is being used.Doses may be different for different patients. Check withthe physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 175Analgesics, opioidGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 175who filled the prescription for correct dosages, and makesure to understand how to take the drug.Always take opioid analgesics exactly as directed.Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not takethe drug for longer than directed. Do not stop taking thedrug suddenly without checking with the physician ordentist who prescribed it. Gradually tapering the dosemay the chance of withdrawal symptoms.
Precautions
Anyone who uses opioid analgesics—or any narcot-ic—over a long time may become physically or mentallydependent on the drug. Physical dependence may lead towithdrawal symptoms when the person stops taking themedicine. Building tolerance to these drugs is also possi-ble when they are used for a long period. Over time, thebody needs larger and larger doses to relieve pain.Take these drugs exactly as directed. Never takemore than the recommended dose, and do not take thedrugs more often than directed. If the drugs do not seemto be working, consult your physician. Do not share theseor any other prescription drugs with others because thedrug may have a completely different effect on the per-son for whom it was not prescribed.Children and older people are especially sensitive toopioid analgesics and may have serious breathing prob-

Children may also becomeunusually restless or agitated when given these drugs.Opioid analgesics increase the effects of alcohol.Anyone taking these drugs should not drink alcoholicbeverages.Some of these drugs may also contain aspirin,caf- feine, or acetaminophen. Refer to the entries on each ofthese drugs for additional precautions.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake opioid analgesics. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions.
ALLERGIES. Let the physician know about any aller- giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substancesand about any previous reactions to opioid analgesics.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or plan tobecome pregnant while taking opioid analgesics shouldlet their physicians know. No evidence exists that thesedrugs cause birth defectsin people, but some do causebirth defects and other problems when given to pregnantanimals in experiments. Babies can become dependenton opioid analgesics if their mothers use too much duringpregnancy. This can cause the baby to go through with-drawal symptoms after birth. If taken just before deliv-ery, some opioid analgesics may cause serious breathingproblems in the newborn.
BREAST FEEDING. Some opioid analgesics can passinto breast milk. Women who are breast feeding shouldcheck with their physicians about the safety of takingthese drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. These conditionsmay influence the effects of opioid analgesics:• head injury. The effects of some opioid analgesics maybe stronger and may interfere with recovery in peoplewith head injuries.• history of convulsions. Some of these drugs may triggerconvulsions.• asthma,emphysema, or any chronic lung disease• heart disease• kidney disease• liver disease• underactive thyroid. The chance of side effects may begreater.• addison’s disease (a disease of the adrenal glands)• colitis• gallbladder disease or gallstones. Side effects can bedangerous in people with these conditions.• enlarged prostate or other urinary problems• current or past alcohol abuse• current or past drug abuse, especially narcotic abuse• current or past emotional problems. The chance of sideeffects may be greater.USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking opioid nar-cotics with certain other drugs may increase the chancesof serious side effects.
Side effects
Some people experience drowsiness, dizziness, light-headedness, or a false sense of well-being after taking opi-oid analgesics. Anyone who takes these drugs should notdrive, use machines, or do anything else that might be dan-gerous until they know how the drug affects them. Nausea and vomitingare common side effects, especially whenfirst beginning to take the medicine. If these symptoms donot go away after the first few doses, check with the physi-cian or dentist who prescribed the medicine.Dry mouthis another common side effect. Drymouth can be relieved by sucking on sugarless hardcandy or ice chips or by chewing sugarless gum. Salivasubstitutes, which come in liquid or tablet forms, alsomay help. Patients who must use opioid analgesics overlong periods and who have dry mouth should see theirdentists, as the problem can lead to tooth decayand other dental problems.The following side effects are less common. Theyusually do not need medical attention and will go awayafter the first few doses. If they continue or interfere withnormal activity, check with the physician who prescribedthe medicine.• headache• loss of appetite• restlessness or nervousness• nightmares, unusual dreams, or problems sleeping• weakness or tiredness• mental sluggishness• stomach pain or cramps• blurred or double vision or other vision problems• problems urinating, such as pain, difficulty urinating,frequent urge to urinate, or decreased amount of urine• constipation.Other side effects may be more serious and mayrequire quick medical attention. These symptoms could

Get emergency medical careimmediately.• cold, clammy skin• bluish discoloration of the skin• extremely small pupils• serious difficulty breathing or extremely slow breathing• extreme sleepiness or unresponsiveness• severe weakness• confusion• severe dizziness• severe drowsiness• slow heartbeat• low blood pressure• severe nervousness or restlessnessIn addition, these less common side effects do notrequire emergency medical care, but should have medicalattention as soon as possible:•hallucinationsor a sense of unreality• depression or other mood changes• ringing or buzzing in the ears• pounding or unusually fast heartbeat• itching,hives, or rash• facial swelling• trembling or twitching• dark urine, pale stools, or yellow eyes or skin (after tak-ing propoxyphene)• increased sweating, red or flushed face (more commonafter taking hydrocodone and meperidine)
Interactions
Anyone taking these drugs should notify his or herphysician before taking opioid analgesics:• Central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as anti- histaminesand other medicines for allergies, hay fever, or colds; tranquilizers; some other prescription painrelievers; seizure medicines; muscle relaxants; sleepingpills; some anesthetics (including dental anesthetics).• Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, such as phenel-zine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). The com-bination of the opioid analgesic meperidine (Demerol)and MAO inhibitors is especially dangerous.• Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil).• Anti-seizure medicines, such as carbamazepine (Tegre-tol). May lead to serious side effects, including coma, when combined with propoxyphene and acetaminophen(Darvocet-N) or propoxyphene (Darvon).KEY TERMS

Anaphylaxis
Definition
Anaphylaxis is a rapidly progressing, life-threaten-ing allergic reaction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 178AnaphylaxisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 178Description
Anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in whichthe immune system responds to otherwise harmless sub-stances from the environment. Unlike other allergicreactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction maybegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, andrapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin andintestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severecases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,shock, and death.
Causes and symptoms
CausesLike the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-laxis is caused by the release of histamine and otherchemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of whiteblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-sues that regulate exchange with the environment: theairways, digestive system, and skin.On their surfaces, mast cells display antibodiescalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodiesare designed to detect environmental substances towhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances froma genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria orviruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-ple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergicresponse, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodiesbind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to releasehistamine and other chemicals, which spill out ontoneighboring cells.The interaction of these chemicals with receptors onthe surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leakfluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-tion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cellsof the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-tion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity andcause itching.In anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both toextreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usuallysystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to causeanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-latory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-tion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-laxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over timefrom less severe allergies.Anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,drugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:• fish, shellfish, and mollusks• nuts and seeds• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets• papain from meat tenderizers• vaccines, including flu and measlesvaccines• penicillin• cephalosporins• streptomycin• gamma globulin• insulin• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)•aspirinand other NSAIDs• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for exampleExposure to cold or exercisecan trigger anaphylaxisin some individuals.SymptomsSymptoms may include:• urticaria (hives)• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth• swelling of the sinuses• difficulty breathing• wheezing• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea• anxiety or confusion• strong, very rapid heartbeat (palpitations)• loss of consciousnessNot all symptoms may be present.
Diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-opment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.Identification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-ing, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specificallergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-phylactic reactions.
Treatment
Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-tion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts bloodvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygenmay be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.Antihistaminesmay be used for skin rash, and amino-phylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway isobstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-my tube may be needed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 179AnaphylaxisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179Prognosis
The rapidity of symptom development is an indica-tion of the likely severity of reaction: the faster symp-toms develop, the more severe the ultimate reaction.Prompt emergency medical attention and close monitor-ing reduces the likelihood of death. Nonetheless, death ispossible from severe anaphylaxis. For most people whoreceive rapid treatment, recovery is complete.
Prevention
Avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliablemethod of preventing anaphylaxis. For insect allergies,this requires recognizing likely nest sites. Preventing foodallergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods ordishes in which the allergen is likely to occur, and carefulquestioning about ingredients when dining out. Use of aMedic-Alert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to preventinadvertent administration during a medical emergency.People prone to anaphylaxis should carry an “Epi-pen” or “Ana-kit,” which contain an adrenaline doseready for injection.Resources

Definition
Anemia is a condition characterized by abnormallylow levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin (thecomponent of red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tis-sues throughout the body).
Description
The tissues of the human body need a regular supplyof oxygen to stay healthy. Red blood cells, which containhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughoutthe body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, theiron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and usedto create new red blood cells. Anemia develops whenheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-thing happens to slow down the production of red bloodcells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.Types of anemiaAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough tolead to life-threatening complications. More than 400different types of anemia have been identified. Many ofthem are rare.
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-miais the most common form of anemia in the world. Inthe United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition isless common in older children and in adults over 50 andrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,at first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiencybegins when the body loses more iron than it derivesfrom food and other sources. Because depleted ironstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer redblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the redblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiencyby producing more red blood cells, which are character-istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.
FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-ciency anemiais the most common type of megaloblas-tic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-mal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, a vitaminthat the body needs to produce normal cells.Folic acid anemia is especially common in infantsand teenagers. Although this condition usually resultsfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inabilityto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 180AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180• cheese• eggs• fish• green vegetables• meat• milk• mushrooms• yeastSmokingraises the risk of developing this conditionby interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C, which thebody needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid anemia can bea complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s bodyneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.
VITAMIN B 12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common inthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B
12deficien- cy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia thatdevelops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of thisnutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B
12
is found in meat and vegetables.Large amounts of B
12are stored in the body, so thiscondition may not become apparent until as much as fouryears after B
12absorption stops or slows down. Theresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:• loss of muscle control• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet• soreness or burning of the tongue• weight loss• yellow-blue color blindnessThe most common form of B
12deficiency is perni- cious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggsget enough B
12in their diets, a deficiency of this vitaminusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.This can occur among people who have had intestinalsurgery or among those who do not produce adequateamounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by thestomach lining that combines with B
12to help its absorp-tion in the small intestine.Pernicious anemia usually strikes between the agesof 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-es the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:• diabetes mellitus•gastritis,stomach cancer, or stomach surgery• thyroid disease• family history of pernicious anemia
VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorderthat causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormallysmall red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemiaresults from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born withhemolytic anemia. Some acquire this condition, inwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cellsmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.Hemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-ing the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Othercomplications of hemolytic anemia include:•pain• shock• gallstones and other serious health problems
THALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolyticanemia,thalassemiastems from the body’s inability tomanufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.There are two categories of thalassemia, depending onwhich of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobinis composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-lassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of thealpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there isan imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias mostcommonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);beta-thalassemias most commonly affect people ofMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.Characterized by production of red blood cells thatare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affectspeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-somal recessive inheritance).
AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-body hemolytic anemia is the most common type of thisdisorder. This condition occurs when the body producesautoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cellsare destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is more commonin women than in men. About one-third of patients whohave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-phoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.In cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacksred blood cells at or below normal body temperature. Theacute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-ple who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or otheracute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, anddisappears without treatment.Chronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is mostcommon in women and most often affects those who areover 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usuallylasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.However, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 181AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181red blood cell destruction, causing fatigue, joint aches,and discoloration of the arms and hands.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Sickle cell anemia is a chron-ic, incurable condition that causes the body to producedefective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells toassume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal ovalcells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobinto nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes ithard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-sels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-ing condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost alwaysaffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. Achild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parentwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cellgene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, butdoes not have the disease.
APLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bonemarrow transplant, but potentially fatal,aplastic anemiais characterized by decreased production of red andwhite blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells thatallow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inheritedor acquired as a result of:• recent severe illness• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals• use of anticancer drugsand certain other medications
ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic infection or inflammation, and kidney and liver diseaseoften cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-ure generally produces the most severe symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Anemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red bloodcell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and irondeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells areproduced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases cancause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-sive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, andthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significanteffect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss isusually a consequence of:• cancer• gastrointestinal tumors• diverticulosis• polyposis• heavy menstrual flow• hemorrhoids• nosebleeds• stomach ulcers• long-standing alcohol abuseAcute blood loss is usually the result of:• childbirth• injury• a ruptured blood vessel• surgeryWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time, bloodpressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-denly. Heart failureand deathcan follow.Loss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume inthe space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual bloodloss is less serious, because the body has time to createnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.SymptomsWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may besigns of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lackof color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, orlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someonewho is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feelsfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic.Other symptoms of anemia are:• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by achokingsensation that provokes severe anxiety) • cravings for ice, paint, or dirt• headache• inability to concentrate, memory loss• inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis) or tongue(glossitis)• insomnia• irregular heartbeat• loss of appetite• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged• rapid breathing• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum• sweating• swelling of the hands and feet• thirst• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)• unexplained bleeding or bruisingIn pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusuallyslick. A patient with pernicious anemia may have:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 182AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 182• problems with movement or balance• tingling in the hands and feet• confusion, depression, and memory lossPernicious anemia can damage the spinal cord. Adoctor should be notified whenever symptoms of thiscondition occur.A doctor should also be notified if a patient who hasbeen taking iron supplements develops:• diarrhea• cramps• vomiting
Diagnosis
Personal and family health history may suggest thepresence of certain types of anemia. Laboratory tests thatmeasure the percentage of red blood cells or the amountof hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosisand determine which type of anemia is responsible for apatient’s symptoms. X rays and examinations of bonemarrow may be used to identify the source of bleeding.
Treatment
Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usuallybe treated at home with iron supplements or self adminis-tered injections of vitamin B
12. People with folic acidanemia should take oral folic acid replacements. VitaminC deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitaminC tablet a day.Surgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused byexcessive loss of blood. Transfusions of red blood cellsmay be used to accelerate production of red blood cells.Medication or surgery may also be necessary to con-trol heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer, orremove polyps (growths or nodules) from the bowels.Patients with thalassemia usually do not requiretreatment. However people with a severe form mayrequire periodic hospitalization for blood transfusionsand/or bone marrow transplantation.

Treatment for sickle cell ane-mia involves regular eye examinations, immunizationsfor pneumonia and infectious diseases, and prompt treat-ment for sickle cell crises and infections of any kind.Psychotherapy or counseling may help patients deal withthe emotional impact of this condition.
VITAMIN B12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A life-long regi-men of B
12shots is necessary to control symptoms of per-nicious anemia. The patient may be advised to limit phys-ical activity until treatment restores strength and balance.APLASTIC ANEMIA. People who have aplastic ane-mia are especially susceptible to infection. Treatment foraplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bonemarrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells withhealthy ones.
ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specifictreatment for anemia associated with chronic disease, buttreating the underlying illness may alleviate this condi-tion. This type of anemia rarely becomes severe. If itdoes, transfusions or hormone treatments to stimulate redblood cell production may be prescribed.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. There is no specific treatmentfor cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About one-third ofpatients with warm-antibody hemolytic anemia respondwell to large doses of intravenous and oral corticos- teroids, which are gradually discontinued as the patient’scondition improves. Patients with this condition whodon’t respond to medical therapy must have the spleensurgically removed. This operation controls anemia inabout half of the patients on whom it’s performed.Immune-system suppressants are prescribed for patientswhose surgery is not successful.Self-careAnyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition should modify his or her diet to include more vitamins, minerals, and iron. Vitamin C can stimulate iron absorp-tion. The following foods are also good sources of iron:• almonds• broccoli

Alternative treatment
As is the case in standard medical treatment, thecause of the specific anemia will determine the alterna-tive treatment recommended. If the cause is a deficiency,for example iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, B

deficiency, or vitamin C deficiency, supplementation isthe treatment. For extensive blood loss, the cause shouldbe identified and corrected. Other types of anemiasshould be addressed on a deep healing level with crisisintervention when necessary.Many alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane-mia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or ontechniques to improve circulation and digestion. Ironsupplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likelyto cause constipation), is used by alternative practition-ers. This can be given in combination with herbs that arerich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-lion (Taraxacum officinale), parsley (Petroselinumcrispum), and nettle (Urtica dioica). The homeopathicremedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.An iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made usingthe following recipe:• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelionroot in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reducedto 1 cup• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,mixing well• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp dailyOther herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiencyanemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian ( Gentiana lutea) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and othernutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-tian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron andother nutrients more available for absorption. This bitterherb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholicextract (tincture).Other herbs recommended to promote digestioninclude:• anise (Pimpinella anisum)• caraway (Carum carvi)• cumin (Cuminum cyminum)• linden (Tiliaspp.)• licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)Traditional Chinese treatments for anemia include:• acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen• asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) to restore energy• dong quai (Angelica sinensis) to control heavy men-strual bleeding• a mixture of dong quai and Chinese foxglove( Rehman-nia glutinosa) to clear a sallow complexion Prognosis
Folic-acid and iron-deficiency anemiasIt usually takes three to six weeks to correct folicacid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continuetaking supplements for another six months to replenishiron reserves and should have periodic blood tests tomake sure the bleeding has stopped and the anemia hasnot recurred.Pernicious anemiaAlthough pernicious anemia is considered incurable,regular B

Some symptoms will disappear almost assoon as treatment begins.Aplastic anemiaAplastic anemia can sometimes be cured by bonemarrow transplantation. If the condition is due toimmunosuppressive drugs, symptoms may disappearafter the drugs are discontinued.Sickle cell anemiaAlthough sickle cell anemia cannot be cured, effec-tive treatments enable patients with this disease to enjoylonger, more productive lives.ThalassemiaPeople with mild thalassemia (alpha thalassemiatrait or beta thalassemia minor) lead normal lives and do

Genetic thera-py is is being investigated and may soon be available.Hemolytic anemiaAcquired hemolytic anemia can generally be curedwhen the cause is removed.
Prevention
Inherited anemias cannot be prevented. Genetic counselingcan help parents cope with questions andconcerns about transmitting disease-causing genes totheir children.Avoiding excessive use of alcohol, eating a balanceddiet that contains plenty of iron-rich foods, and taking adaily multivitamin can help prevent anemia.Methods of preventing specific types of anemiainclude:• avoiding lengthy exposure to industrial chemicals anddrugs known to cause aplastic anemia• not taking medication that has triggered hemolytic ane-mia and not eating foods that have caused hemolysis(breakdown of red blood cells)• receiving regular B

Anesthesia, general
Definition
General anesthesia is the induction of a state of uncon-sciousness with the absence of painsensation over theentire body, through the administration of anesthetic drugs.It is used during certain medical and surgical procedures.
Purpose
General anesthesia has many purposes including:• pain relief (analgesia)• blocking memory of the procedure (amnesia)• producing unconsciousness• inhibiting normal body reflexes to make surgery safeand easier to perform• relaxing the muscles of the body
Description
Anesthesia performed with general anestheticsoccurs in four stages which may or may not be observ-able because they can occur very rapidly:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 185Anesthesia, generalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 185• Stage One: Analgesia. The patient experiences analge-sia or a loss of pain sensation but remains consciousand can carry on a conversation.• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experiencedeliriumor become violent. Blood pressure rises andbecomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. Thisstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-rate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, theskeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathingbecomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, andsurgery can begin.• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis. This stage occurs ifthe respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of thebrain that control breathing and other vital functionscease to function. Deathcan result if the patient cannotbe revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-tered prevent this occurrence.Agents used for general anesthesia may be eithergases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaledwith oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia; thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.General anesthesia works by altering the flow ofsodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through thecell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It isknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not thesame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-sciousness is more widespread.When general anesthesia was first introduced inmedical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled withthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.Since then, general anesthesia has become much moresophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and caneasily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used withother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxicto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has thepotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently theanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since theintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothaneuse has declined.• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in amore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakeningthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer ofparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found toincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients withseizure disorders.• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but cancause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is oftenused in combination with intravenous anesthetics foranesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia isfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate andshould not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-sis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-mias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitationduring induction and is therefore used with intravenousanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-nated and awakening is therefore faster than with otherinhaled agents.• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heartrate and should not be used in patients with narrowedaortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usuallycause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-rane does not cause any coughing or other related sideeffects, and can therefore be used without intravenousagents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluoraneis replacing halothane for induction in pediatricpatients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-nated and allows rapid awakening.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 186Anesthesia, generalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 186• Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and isused with other agents, such as thiopental, to producesurgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction andrecovery and is the safest because it does not slowbreathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-es rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in acollapsed lung (pneumothorax) or lower the oxygencontents of tissues (hypoxia).Commonly administered intravenous anestheticagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces adissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia)in which the patient may appear awake and reactive, butcannot respond to sensory stimuli. These propertiesmake it especially useful for use in developing coun-tries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine isfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesiaand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscularinjection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patientsand in shockcases, because it also provides cardiacstimulation.• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces arapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-tal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-tion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuouslyinfused. Side effects include nausea and vomitingupon awakening.• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, andare frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as asedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusionfor primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affectthe cardiovascular system, they are particularly usefulfor cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioidsact directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqentlyused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects mayinclude nausea and vomiting,itching, and respiratorydepression.• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agentand the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.Its rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-tical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quicklyand with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted inthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-thesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidlyreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.It is used for general surgery, cardiac surgery, neuro-surgery, and pediatric surgery.General anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-gists, the medical professionals trained to use them. Thesespecialists consider many factors, including a patient’sage, weight, medication allergies, medical history, andgeneral health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-nation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-ly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injectedinto a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.General anesthesia is much safer today than it was inthe past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,improved safety standards in the equipment used todeliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-ing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity duringsurgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.
Recommended dosage
The dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, thepatient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgeryor medical procedure being done, and other medicationthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.
Precautions
Although the risks of serious complications fromgeneral anesthesia are very low, they can include heart attack,stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-uled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughlydiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risksof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking, drinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can beminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-ologist are fully informed of the detailed health conditionof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may beusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effectsof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-ence side effects from these drugs.Patients who have had general anesthesia should notdrink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slowdown the central nervous system (such as antihista-mines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain painrelievers,muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication)for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions are at greaterrisk of developing problems with anesthetics. Beforeundergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow-ing conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had allergic or otherunusual reactions to barbituratesor general anestheticsin the past should notify the doctor before having generalanesthesia. In particular, people who have had malignanthyperthermia or whose family members have had malig-nant hyperthermia during or after being given an anes-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 187Anesthesia, generalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 187thetic should inform the physician. Signs of malignanthyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-ing problems, very high fever, and muscle tightness orspasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also betold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, orother substances.
PREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnantwomen and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. Ingeneral, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to themother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the useof anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia forother medical procedures should ensure that the treatingphysician is informed about the pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. Some general anesthetics pass intobreast milk, but they have not been reported to cause prob-lems in nursing babies whose mothers were given the drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before being givena general anesthetic, a patient who has any of the follow-ing conditions should inform his or her doctor:• neurological conditions, such as epilepsy or stroke• problems with the stomach or esophagus, such as ulcersor heartburn• eating disorders• loose teeth, dentures, bridgework• heart disease or family history of heart problems• lung diseases, such as emphysemaor asthma• history of smoking• immune system diseases• arthritis or any other conditions that affect movement• diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes orthyroid problemsSide effects
Because general anesthetics affect the central ner-vous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tiredfor as long as a few days after having general anesthesia.Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination prob-lems are also possible. For these reasons, anyone whohas had general anesthesia should not drive, operatemachinery, or perform other activities that could endan-ger themselves or others for at least 24 hours, or longerif necessary.Most side effects usually disappear as the anestheticwears off. A nurse or doctor should be notified if these orother side effects persist or cause problems, such as:•Headache• vision problems, including blurred or double vision• shivering or trembling• muscle pain• dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness• drowsiness• mood or mental changes• nausea or vomiting• sore throat• nightmares or unusual dreamsA doctor should be notified as soon as possible ifany of the following side effects occur within two weeksof having general anesthesia:• severe headache• pain in the stomach or abdomen• back or leg pain• severe nausea• black or bloody vomit• unusual tiredness or weakness• weakness in the wrist and fingers• weight loss or loss of appetite

Interactions
General anesthetics may interact with other medi-cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both ofthe drugs may be altered or the risk of side effects maybe greater. Anyone scheduled to undergo general anes-thesia should inform the doctor about all other medica-tion that he or she is taking. This includes prescriptiondrugs, nonprescription medicines, and street drugs. Seri-ous and possibly life-threatening reactions may occurwhen general anesthetics are given to people who usestreet drugs, such as cocaine, marijuana, phencyclidine(PCP or angel dust), amphetamines (uppers), barbiturates(downers), heroin, or other narcotics. Anyone who usesthese drugs should make sure their doctor or dentistknows what they have taken.Resources

Anesthesia, local
Definition
Local or regional anesthesia involves the injection orapplication of an anesthetic drug to a specific area of thebody, as opposed to the entire body and brain as occursduring general anesthesia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 189Anesthesia, localGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 189Purpose
Local anesthetics are used to prevent patients fromfeeling painduring medical, surgical, or dental proce-dures. Over-the-counter local anesthetics are also avail-able to provide temporary relief from pain, irritation, anditchingcaused by various conditions, such as cold sores,canker sores, sore throats,sunburn, insect bites, poisonivy, and minor cuts and scratches.Types of surgery or medical procedures that regular-ly make use of local or regional anesthesia include thefollowing:• biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken fordiagnostic procedures• childbirth• surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet• eye surgery• surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organsSurgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu-ally performed under general anesthesia.Local and regional anesthesia have advantages overgeneral anesthesia in that patients can avoid someunpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting painrelief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a sense ofpsychological comfort by not losing consciousness.
Description
Regional anesthesia typically affects a larger area thanlocal anesthesia, for example, everything below the waist.As a result, regional anesthesia may be used for moreinvolved or complicated surgical or medical procedures.Regional anesthetics are injected. Local anesthesia involvesthe injection into the skin or muscle or application to theskin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Localanesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi-cal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic.Local and regional anesthesia work by altering theflow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neuronsthrough the cell membrane. Exactly how the anestheticdoes this is not understood, since the drug apparentlydoes not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and doesnot seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmitnerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules donot get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat-ed and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. Theduration of action of an anesthetic depends on the typeand amount of anesthetic administered.Regional anesthesiaTypes of regional anesthesia include:• Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec-tion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly intothe cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (thesubarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com-mon but are easily treated.• Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves theinjection of a large volume of local anesthetic directlyinto the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (theepidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain reliefoccurs more slowly but is less likely to produce bloodpressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained forlong periods, even days.• Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of ananesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies aparticular region of the body, preventing the nerve fromcarrying nerve impulses to the brain.Anesthetics may be administered with another drug,such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed-ing, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of adrug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may beadministered to help a patient remain calm and morecomfortable or to make them sleepy.Local anesthesiaINJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicinesare given by injection to numb and provide pain relief tosome part of the body during surgery, dental procedures,or other medical procedures. They are given only by atrained health care professional and only in a doctor’soffice or a hospital. Some commonly used injectablelocal anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine(Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine,and other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine).
TOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such asbenzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben,and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening thenerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari-ety of nonprescription products that are applied to theskin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites orstings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns. These products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays,lotions, and gels.
DENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some local anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouthor throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain,teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis-comfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Somedental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre-scription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip-tion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo-raseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 190Anesthesia, localGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 190OPHTHALMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anestheticsare designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic anestheticsproparacaine and tetracaine are used to numb the eyebefore certain eye examinations. Eye doctors may also usethese medicines before measuring eye pressure or remov-ing stitches or foreign objectsfrom the eye. These drugsare to be given only by a trained health care professional.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type oflocal anesthetic and the purpose for which it is beingused. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic, fol-low the directions on the package. Questions concerninghow to use a product should be referred to a medical doc-tor, dentist, or pharmacist.
Precautions
People who strongly feel that they cannot psycho-logically cope with being awake and alert during certainprocedures may not be good candidates for local orregional anesthesia. Other medications may be given inconjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi- etyand help the patient relax.Local anesthetics should be used only for the condi-tions for which they are intended. For example, a topicalanesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not beused on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-tion to any local anesthetic in the past should check witha doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again.The doctor should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.Older people may be more sensitive to the effects oflocal anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen-sitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older peoplewho use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe-cially careful not to use more than the recommendedamount. Children also may be especially sensitive to theeffects of some local anesthetics, which may increase thechance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on achild should be careful not to use more than the amountthat is recommended for children. Certain types of localanesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol-low package directions carefully and check with a doctorof pharmacist if there are any questions.Regional anestheticsSerious, possibly life-threatening, side effects mayoccur when anesthetics are given to people who usestreet drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine,marijuana, amphetamines,barbiturates, phencyclidine (PCP, orangel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should makesure their doctor or dentist knows what they have used.Patients who have had a particular kind of reactioncalled malignant hyperthermia (or who have one or morefamily members who have had this problem) during orjust after receiving a general anesthetic should informtheir doctors before receiving any kind of anesthetic.Signs of malignant hyperthermia include fast and irregu-lar heartbeat, very high fever, breathing problems, andmuscle spasms or tightness.Although problems are rare, some unwanted sideeffects may occur when regional anesthetics are usedduring labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolonglabor and increase the risk of Cesarean section. Preg- nant women should discuss with their doctors the risksand benefits of being given these drugs.Patients should not drive or operate other machineryimmediately following a procedure involving regionalanesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if localanesthesia also included drugs to make the patient sleepor strong pain medications. Injection sites should be keptclean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection.Injectable local anestheticsUntil the anesthetic wears off, patients should becareful not to injure the numbed area. If the anestheticwas used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until feel-ing returns.Topical anestheticsUnless advised by a doctor, topical anestheticsshould not be used on or near any part of the bodywith large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury,or infection. They should also not be used on largeareas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcoholand should not be used near an open flame, or whilesmoking.Anyone using a topical anesthetic should be carefulnot to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or mouth.When using a spray form of this medication, do not sprayit directly on the face, but apply it to the face with a cot-ton swab or sterile gauze pad. After using a topical anes-thetic on a child, make sure the child does not get themedicine in his or her mouth.Topical anesthetics are intended for the temporaryrelief of pain and itching. They should not be used formore than a few days at a time. Check with a doctor if:• the discomfort continues for more than seven days• the problem gets worse• the treated area becomes infected• new signs of irritation, such as skin rash, burning, sting-ing, or swelling appear

If problems such as toothache, mouth sores,or pain from dentures or braces continue, check with adentist. Check with a doctor if sore throatpain is severe,lasts more than two days, or is accompanied by othersymptoms such as fever,headache, skin rash, swelling,nausea, or vomiting.Patients should not eat or chew gum while the mouthis numb from a dental anesthetic. There is a risk of acci-dently biting the tongue or the inside of the mouth. Alsonothing should be eaten or drunk for one hour afterapplying a dental anesthetic to the back of the mouth orthroat, since the medicine may interfere with swallowingand may cause choking. If normal feeling does notreturn to the mouth within a few hours after receiving adental anesthetic or if it is difficult to open the mouth,check with a dentist.Ophthalmic anestheticsWhen anesthetics are used in the eye, it is importantnot to rub or wipe the eye until the effect of the anesthet-ic has worn off and feeling has returned. Rubbing the eyewhile it is numb could cause injury.
Side effects
Side effects of regional or local anesthetics varydepending on the type of anesthetic used and the way it isadministered. Anyone who has unusual symptoms fol-lowing the use of an anesthetic should get in touch withhis or her doctor immediately.Paralysisafter regional anesthesia, for example anepidural or spinal block, is extremely rare, but can occur.Paralysis reportedly occurs even less frequently thandeaths due to general anesthesia.There is a small risk of developing a severeheadache called a spinal headache following a spinal orepidural block. This headache is severe when the patientis upright and hardly felt when the patient lies down.Though rare, it can occur and can be treated by perform-ing a blood patch, in which a small amount of thepatient’s own blood is injected into the area in the backwhere the anesthetic was injected. The blood clots andcloses up any area that may have been leaking spinalfluid. Relief is almost immediate. Finally, blood clots orabscesscan form in the back, but these are also readilytreatable and so pose little risk.KEY TERMS

Aneurysmectomy
Definition
Aneurysmectomy is a surgical procedure performedto repair a weak area in the aorta. The aorta is the largestartery in the body and the main blood vessel leadingaway from the heart.
Purpose
The purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor- tic aneurysmthat is likely to rupture if left in place.Aneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm thatgrows to at least 2 in (5 cm) or for an aortic aneurysm ofany size that is symptomatic, tender, or enlarging rapidly.
Precautions
Aneurysmectomy may not be appropriate forpatients with severely debilitating diseases such as can- cer,emphysema, and heart failure.
Description
An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aortathat is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis. People who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel-op an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likelyto develop one than women.An aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. Itrarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosedby accident during a routine physical exam or on an x rayor ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysmgrows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, whichcauses catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aorticaneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of bloodwithin minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleedsthat lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak-ing aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal.Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the twomost common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor-tic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid-neys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in thechest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital undergeneral anesthesia and involves removing debris andthen implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace theenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of theascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travelsupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lungmachine that temporarily stops the heart while theaneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.During surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either theabdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to exposethe aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below theaneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision ismade in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn inplace above and below the opened aneurysm, but theaneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood arecleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removedand blood flow is re-established through the graft. Thewall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro-tect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.Aneurysmectomy can be performed as elective oremergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes aboutan hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy,with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominalaneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracicaneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% ofpatients die before they reach the hospital. Of those whomake it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. Aftera successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly thesame life expectancy as other people of the same age.
Preparation
Before elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, achest x ray, cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.
Aftercare
After aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored inan Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours. Follow-up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound.
Risks
Elective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli-cations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com-plications,heart attack,stroke, infection, limb loss, bowelischemia, and impotence. These complications are manytimes more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.

Angina
Definition
Angina is pain, “discomfort,” or pressure localizedin the chest that is caused by an insufficient supply ofblood (ischemia) to the heart muscle. It is also some-times characterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation,or crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-na pectoris.
Description
Often described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-sation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describechest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygento the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actualheart attack, but rather pain that results from the heartmuscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-porary condition may be the result of demanding activi-ties such as exerciseand does not necessarily indicatethat the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.In fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-age to heart muscle.Angina can be subdivided further into two cate-gories: angina of effort and variant angina.Angina of effortAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by thenarrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that supplyoxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case ofangina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can providethe heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood duringrest but not during periods of exercise,stress, or excite-ment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain isrelieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, amedication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patientswith angina of effort have an increased risk of heartattack (myocardial infarction).V ariant anginaVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-dently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be presentas an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest andis not related to excessive work by the heart muscle.Research indicates that variant angina is caused by coro-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 194AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 194nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration orintensity to cause an actual heart attack.
Causes and symptoms
Angina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-ness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-num). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occurwhen the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond theoxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, thecondition is often precipitated by physical exertion. Inmost cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-utes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-tions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavymeals, cigarette smoking, and alcohol can also cause orcontribute to an episode of angina.
Diagnosis
Physicians can usually diagnose angina based on thepatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-er, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm orrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-lying heart disease.Electrocardiogram (ECG)An electrocardiogram is a test that records electricalimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electricalactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioningproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-grams are also useful in investigating other possibleabnormal features of the heart.Stress testFor many individuals with angina, the results of anelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-malities. Because the symptoms of angina occur duringstress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu-ated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress testrecords information from the electrocardiogram before,during, and after exercise in search of stress-relatedabnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured duringthe stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involvedand complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning)may be used in some cases to picture the blood flow inthe heart muscle during the most intense time of exerciseand after rest.AngiogramThe angiogram, which is basically an x ray of thecoronary artery, has been noted to be the most accuratediagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent ofcoronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexibletube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located inthe forearm or groin. This catheter is passed furtherthrough the artery into one of the two major coronaryarteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays“see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief xrays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowingthrough the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos-sible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow tothe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.Treatment
Conservative treatmentArtery disease causing angina is addressed initially bycontrolling existing factors placing the individual at risk.These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high bloodpressure,high cholesterollevels, and obesity. Angina isoften controlled by medication, most commonly withnitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina byincreasing the diameter of the blood vessels carryingblood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken wheneverdiscomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken bymouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder-mally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. Inaddition,beta blockersor calcium channel blockersmay be prescribed to also decrease the demand on theheart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart.Surgical treatmentWhen conservative treatments are not effective inthe reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attackremains high, physicians may recommend angioplastyor surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera-tion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgicallyremoved from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked arteryto bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path-way allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.Another procedure used to improve blood flow tothe heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, thephysician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the endinto a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread-ed up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat-ed to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech-niques using laser and mechanical devices are beingdeveloped and applied, also by means of catheters.
Alternative treatment
During an angina episode, relief has been noted byapplying massage or kinesiological methods, but thesetechniques are not standard recommendations by physi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 195AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 195cians. For example, one technique places the palm andfingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane-ously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up anddown its entire length using the other hand. This is fol-lowed by additional massaging by the fingertip andthumb next to the sternum, on each side.Once the angina has subsided, the cause should bedetermined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat-ed cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari-ly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugarand saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con-ventional and alternative medicine agree that increasingexercise and improving diet are important steps to reducehigh cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro-posed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev-eral gaining the attention and interest of the public. Oneof the most recent popular treatments is garlic ( Allium sativum). Some studies have shown that adequate dosagesof garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL(bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles-terol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significantbenefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as greatas that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be ofbenefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with-out causing the side effects associated with cholesterol-reducing drugs. Other herbal remedies that may helplower cholesterol include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenu- greek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), Asian ginseng(Panax ginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa).Antioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida-tive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be aprecursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.
Prognosis
The prognosis for a patient with angina depends onits origin, type, severity, and the general health of theindividual. A person who has angina has the best progno-sis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learnsthe pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes theattacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usuallylast, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat-terns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp-toms resemble those of a heart attack, medical helpshould be sought immediately.
Prevention
In most cases, the best prevention involves changingone’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina. Ifblood pressure medication has been prescribed, compli-ance is a necessity and should be a priority as well. Manyhealthcare professionals—including physicians, dieti-KEY TERMS

Angiography
Definition
Angiography is the x-ray study of the blood vessels.An angiogram uses a radiopaque substance, or dye, to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 196AngiographyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 196make the blood vessels visible under x ray. Arteriography isa type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries.
Purpose
Angiography is used to detect abnormalities orblockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle-rosis; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func-tion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect ananeurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup-ture leading to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteri- ovenous malformations(abnormals tangles of arteriesand veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems withthe retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons anaccurate “map” of the heart prior to open-heart surgery,or of the brain prior to neurosurgery.
Precautions
Patients with kidney disease or injury may sufferfurther kidney damage from the contrast mediums usedfor angiography. Patients who have blood clotting prob-lems, have a known allergy to contrast mediums, or areallergic to iodine, a component of some contrast medi-ums, may also not be suitable candidates for an angiogra-phy procedure. Because x rays carry risks of ionizingradiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are alsoadvised to avoid this procedure.
Description
Angiography is usually performed at a hospital by atrained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse. Ittakes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for mosttypes of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will bemonitored throughout the procedure.Angiography requires the injection of a contrast dyethat makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye isinjected through a procedure known as arterial puncture. The puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep-tic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, asmall incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert-ed through the skin into the artery. When the radiologisthas punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet isremoved and replaced with another long wire called aguide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee-dle before the guide wire is inserted.The guide wire is fed through the outer needle intothe artery and to the area that requires angiographicstudy. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of thepatient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to thecorrect location. Once it is in position, the needle isremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of theguide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa-ration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye.Depending on the type of angiography procedurebeing performed, the contrast medium is either injectedby hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected withan automatic injector connected to the catheter. Anautomatic injector is used frequently because it is ableto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to theangiogram site. The patient is warned that the injectionwill start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-tion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possibleside effects or reactions include headache,dizziness, irregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation,and chest pain, but they usually last only momentarily.To view the area of study from different angles or per-spectives, the patient may be asked to change positionsseveral times, and subsequent dye injections may beadministered. During any injection, the patient or thecamera may move.Throughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic-tures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) willbe taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial bloodflow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s systemquickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession.

Pressure isapplied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for 10-20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and thearterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage isthen applied.Most angiograms follow the general procedures out-lined above, but vary slightly depending on the area ofthe vascular system being studied. A variety of commonangiography procedures are outlined below:Cerebral angiographyCerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,blood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain.The catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid arteryand the injected contrast medium travels through theblood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experienceheadache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head orneck during the injection portion of the procedure. Acerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete.Coronary angiographyCoronary angiography is administered by a cardiol-ogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by aradiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in thefemoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire andcatheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray serieson the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placedin the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aorticvalves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view ofthe right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul-monic valves, the catheter will be inserted through alarge vein and guided into the right ventricle. Thecatheter also serves the purpose of monitoring bloodpressures in these different locations inside the heart. Theangiogram procedure takes several hours, depending onthe complexity of the procedure.Pulmonary angiographyPulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed toevaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid-ered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul- monary embolism. The procedure differs from cerebraland coronary angiograms in that the guide wire andcatheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, andare guided up through the chambers of the heart and intothe pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, thepatient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that thecatheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias, or irregular heart-beats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul-monary artery where it circulates through the lung capil-laries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes.Kidney angiographyPatients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf-fer further damage to their kidneys from the contrastmedium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they oftenrequire the test to evaluate kidney function. Thesepatients should be well-hydrated with a intravenoussaline drip before the procedure, and may benefit fromavailable medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro-tect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents.During a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheterare inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area andadvanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery inthe abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedurewill take approximately one hour.Fluorescein angiographyFluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinalproblems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con-ducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupilsare dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore-head against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodiumfluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a veinin the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through thepatient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. Theprocedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid seriesof close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken,one set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec-ond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye hasmoved through the patient’s vascular system. The entireprocedure takes up to one hour.Celiac and mesenteric angiographyCeliac and mesenteric angiography involves x-rayexploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterialbranches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to theabdomen and digestive system. The test is commonlyused to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs ofischemiain the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and tolocate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is alsoused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ-ing portal hypertension, and cirrhosis. The procedurecan take up to three hours, depending on the number ofblood vessels studied.SplenoportographyA splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogramthat involves the injection of contrast medium directlyinto the spleen to view the splenic and portal veins. It isused to diagnose blockages in the splenic vein and portal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 198AngiographyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 198vein thrombosis and to assess the strength and location ofthe vascular system prior to liver transplantation.Most angiography procedures are typically paid for bymajor medical insurance. Patients should check with theirindividual insurance plans to determine their coverage.
Preparation
Patients undergoing an angiogram are advised tostop eating and drinking eight hours prior to the proce-dure. They must remove all jewelry before the procedureand change into a hospital gown. If the arterial punctureis to be made in the armpit or groin area, shaving may berequired. A sedative may be administered to relax thepatient for the procedure. An IV line will also be insertedinto a vein in the patient’s arm before the procedurebegins in case medication or blood products are requiredduring the angiogram.Prior to the angiography procedure, patients will bebriefed on the details of the test, the benefits and risks,KEY TERMS

Aftercare
Because life-threatening internal bleeding is a possi-ble complication of an arterial puncture, an overnight stayin the hospital is sometimes recommended following anangiography procedure, particularly with cerebral andcoronary angiograms. If the procedure is performed on anoutpatient basis, the patient is typically kept under closeobservation for a period of at six to 12 hours before beingreleased. If the arterial puncture was performed in thefemoral artery, the patient will be instructed to keep hisleg straight and relatively immobile during the observa-tion period. The patient’s blood pressure and vital signswill be monitored and the puncture site observed closely.Pain medication may be prescribed if the patient is expe-riencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack isapplied to the site to reduce swelling. It is normal for thepuncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks.

Patients who experience continued bleeding orabnormal swelling of the puncture site, sudden dizziness,or chest pains in the days following an angiography pro-cedure should seek medical attention immediately.Patients undergoing a fluorescein angiographyshould not drive or expose their eyes to direct sunlightfor 12 hours following the procedure.
Risks
Because angiography involves puncturing an artery,internal bleeding or hemorrhage are possible complica-tions of the test. As with any invasive procedure, infec-tion of the puncture site or bloodstream is also a risk, butthis is rare.A strokeor heart attackmay be triggered by anangiogram if blood clots or plaque on the inside of thearterial wall are dislodged by the catheter and form ablockage in the blood vessels or artery. The heart mayalso become irritated by the movement of the catheterthrough its chambers during pulmonary and coronaryangiography procedures, and arrhythmias may develop.Patients who develop an allergic reaction to the con-trast medium used in angiography may experience a vari-ety of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breath-ing,heart failure, or a sudden drop in blood pressure. Ifthe patient is aware of the allergy before the test isadministered, certain medications can be administered atthat time to counteract the reaction.Angiography involves minor exposure to radiationthrough the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance used in theprocedure. Unless the patient is pregnant, or multipleradiological or fluoroscopic studies are required, thesmall dose of radiation incurred during a single proce-dure poses little risk. However, multiple studies requiringfluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short timeperiod have been known to cause skin necrosis in someindividuals. This risk can be minimized by careful moni-toring and documentation of cumulative radiation dosesadministered to these patients.
Normal results
The results of an angiogram or arteriogram dependon the artery or organ system being examined. Generally,test results should display a normal and unimpeded flowof blood through the vascular system. Fluoresceinangiography should result in no leakage of fluoresceindye through the retinal blood vessels.Abnormal results
Abnormal results of an angiography may display arestricted blood vessel or arterial blood flow (ischemia)or an irregular placement or location of blood vessels.The results of an angiography vary widely by the type ofprocedure performed, and should be interpreted andexplained to the patient by a trained radiologist.Resources

Angioplasty
Definition
Angioplasty is a term describing a procedure used towiden vessels narrowed by stenoses or occlusions. Thereare various types of these procedures and their names areassociated with the type of vessel entry and equipmentused. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) andnavigates to the area of the vessel of interest through thesame vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi-nal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronaryarteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in thegroin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed throughthe aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteriesat the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.
Purpose
In individuals with an occulsive vascular diseasesuch as atherosclerosis, blood flow is impaired to anorgan (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such asthe lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen dueto fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow-ing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere.Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flowis returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at thesame location and the procedure could be repeated.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 200AngioplastyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 200Precautions
Angioplasty procedures are performed on hospitalinpatients in facilities for proper monitoring and recov-ery. If the procedure is to be performed in a coronaryartery, the patient’s care is likely to be provided by spe-cially trained physicians, nurses, and vascular specialists.Typically, patients are given anticoagulants prior to theprocedure to assist in the prevention of thromboses(blood clots). Administration of anticoagulants, however,may impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. Theprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidanceand contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio-plasty may have been made following a diagnosticangiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrastmedia is likely to known. The procedure may thenrequire the use of non-ionic contrast agents.
Description
Angioplasty was originally performed by dilating thevessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiffcatheters through the narrowed space. Complications ofthis procedure caused researchers to develop means ofwidening the vessel using a minimally sized device.Today, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widenthe vessel and stents to provide structural support for thevessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of thefat or calcium plaque. Catheters may also be equippedwith spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque.Angioplasty may be performed while the patient issedated or anesthetized, depending on the vesselsinvolved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-plasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will bekept awake to report on discomfort and coughif required. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac catheterizationlabs with sophisticated monitoringdevices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiologydepartment’s angiographic suite, the patient may besedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor thepatient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performedby a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will beperformed in an operating room or specially designedvascular procedure suite.The site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip-ment is prepared as a sterile surgical site. Although manyprocedures are performed by puncturing the vesselthrough skin, many procedures are also performed bysurgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of thevessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to thevessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel ispunctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopyis used to monitor small injections of contrast media usedto visualize the path through the vessel. If the fluo-roscopy system has a feature called ‘roadmap’, theamount of contrast media injected will be greater in orderto define the full route the guidewire will take. The fluo-roscopy system will then superimpose subsequentimages over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed,that is, the physician moves the guidewire along the mapto the destination.Having reached the area of stenosis, the physicianwill inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been

In some cases, the use of a stent (a mesh of wirethat resembles a Chinese finger puzzle) may also beused. The vessel may be widened before, during, or afterthe deployment of the stent. Procedures for deployingstents are dependent on the type of stent used. In caseswhere the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of vessels,the use of a graph may be necessary to provide structuralstrength to the vessel. Stents, graphs, and balloon dila-tion may all be used together or separately.The procedure is verified using fluoroscopy andcontrast media to produce an angiogram or by usingintravascular ultrasound or both. All equipment is with-drawn from the vessel and the puncture site repaired.
Risks
During the procedure there is a danger of puncturingthe vessel with the guidewire. This is a very small risk.Patients must be monitored for hematoma or hemorrhageat the puncture site. There is also a small risk of heart attack, emboli, and although unlikely death. Hospital-ization will vary in length by the patient’s overall condi-tion, any complications, and availability of home care.Resources

Angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors
Definition
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (alsocalled ACE inhibitors) are medicines that block the con-version of the chemical angiotensin I to a substance thatincreases salt and water retention in the body.
Purpose
ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of highblood pressure. They may be used alone or in combina-tion with other medicines for high blood pressure. Theywork by preventing a chemical in the blood, angiotensinI, from being converted into a substance that increasessalt and water retention in the body. Increased salt andwater retention lead to high blood pressure. ACEinhibitors also make blood vessels relax, which helpslower blood pressure and allows more oxygen-rich bloodto reach the heart.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 202Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 202Treating high blood pressure is important becausethe condition puts a burden on the heart and the arteries,which can lead to permanent damage over time. Ifuntreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heartattacks,heart failure,stroke, or kidney failure.ACE inhibitors may also be prescribed for otherconditions. For example, captopril (Capoten) is used totreat kidney problems in people who take insulin to con-trol diabetes. Captopril and lisinopril are also given tosome patients after a heart attack. Heart attacks dam-age and weaken the heart muscle, and the damage con-tinues even after a person recovers from the attack. Thismedicine helps slow down further damage to the heart.ACE inhibitors also may be used to treat congestiveheart failure.
Description
ACE inhibitors are available only with a physician’sprescription and come in tablet, capsule, and injectableforms. Some commonly used ACE inhibitors arebenazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril(Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil,Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril (Aceon),quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and trandolapril(Mavik).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofACE inhibitor and the medical condition for which it isbeing taken. Check with the physician who prescribedthe drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription forthe correct dosage.This medicine may take weeks to noticeably lowerblood pressure. Take it exactly as directed.Do not stop taking this medicine without checkingwith the physician who prescribed it.
Precautions
A person taking an ACE inhibitor should see aphysician regularly. The physician will check the bloodpressure to make sure the medicine is working as itshould and will note any unwanted side effects. Peoplewho have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine.However, they should continue to see their physicianseven when they feel well so that the physician can keepa close watch on their condition. It is also important forpatients to keep taking their medicine even when theyfeel fine.ACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure,but will help control the condition. To avoid the serioushealth problems that high blood pressure can cause,patients may have to take medicine for the rest of theirlives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoidcertain foods, such as salty snacks, and keep their weightunder control. The health care professional who is treat-ing the condition can offer advice on what measures maybe necessary. Patients being treated for high blood pres-sure should not change their dietswithout consultingtheir physicians.Anyone taking this medicine for high blood pressureshould not take any other prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medicine without first checking with hisor her physician. Some medicines, such as certain coldremedies, may increase blood pressure.Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded after takingthe first dose of an ACE inhibitor, especially if theyhave been taking a water pill (diuretic). Anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them. Such symptomsshould be reported to the physician or pharmacist ifthey do not subside within a day or so. For the first oneor two days of taking an ACE inhibitor, patients maybecome lightheaded when arising from bed in themorning. Patienst should rise slowly to a sitting posi-tion before standing up.While a goal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor is tolower the blood pressure, patients must be careful not tolet their blood pressure get too low. Low blood pressurecan lead to dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. To prevent the blood pressure from getting too low, observethese precautions:• Do not drink alcohol without checking with the physi-cian who prescribed this medicine.• Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hourbefore meals. Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken withor without meals.• Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot weather.The loss of water from the body through heavy sweat-ing can cause low blood pressure.• Check with a physician right away if illness occurswhile taking an ACE inhibitor. This is especially true ifthe illness involves severe nausea, vomiting, or diar- rhea. V omiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of toomuch water from the body, which can lead to low bloodpressure.Anyone who is taking ACE inhibitors should be sureto tell the health care professional in charge before hav-ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-gency treatment.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 203Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 203Some ACE inhibitors may change the results of cer-tain medical tests, such as blood or urine tests. Beforehaving medical tests, anyone taking this medicine shouldalert the health care professional in charge.Do not use a potassium supplement or a salt substi-tute that contains potassium without first checking withthe physician who prescribed the ACE inhibitor.Patients who are being treated with bee or waspvenom to prevent allergic reactions to stings may have asevere allergic reaction to certain ACE inhibitors.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake ACE inhibitors. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions.
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto an ACE inhibitor in the past should let his or herphysician know before taking this type of medicineagain. The physician should also be told about any aller- giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. The use of ACE inhibitors in preg- nancycan cause serious problems and even deathin the fetus or newborn. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using this medicine. Women who become preg-nant while taking this medicine should check with theirphysicians immediately.
BREASTFEEDING. Some ACE inhibitors pass intobreast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should checkwith their physicians before using ACE inhibitors.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ACEinhibitors, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:• diabetes• heart or blood vessel disease• recent heart attack or stroke• liver disease• kidney disease• kidney transplant• scleroderma• systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking ACE inhibitorswith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.Side effects
The most common side effect is a dry, continuingcough. This usually does not subside unless the medica-tion is stopped. Ask the physician if the cough can betreated. Less common side effects, such as headache, loss of taste, unusual tiredness, and nausea or diarrheaalso may occur and do not need medical attention unlessthey are severe or they interfere with normal activities.More serious side effects are rare, but may occur. Ifany of the following side effects occur, check with aphysician immediately:• swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs,hands, or feet• itchy skin• sudden breathing or swallowing problems• chest pain• hoarseness• sore throat• fever and chills• stomach pain• yellow eyes or skinIn addition, anyone who has any of the followingsymptoms while taking an ACE inhibitor should checkwith his or her physician as soon as possible:• dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting• confusion• nervousness•f e v e r• joint pain• numbness or tingling in hands, feet, or lips• weak or heavy feeling in the legs• skin rash• irregular heartbeat• shortness of breath or other breathing problemsOther side effects may occur. Anyone who hasunusual symptoms after taking an ACE inhibitor shouldget in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
ACE inhibitors may interact with certain foods andother medicines. For example, captopril (Capoten) inter-acts with food and should be taken one hour beforemeals. Anyone who takes ACE inhibitors should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is takingand should ask about foods that should be avoided.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 204Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 204Among the foods and drugs that may interact with ACEinhibitors are:• water pills (diuretics)• lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder• tetracycline, an antibiotic• medicines or supplements that contain potassium• salt substitutes that contain potassiumThe list above may not include everything that inter-acts with ACE inhibitors. Be sure to check with a physi-cian or pharmacist before combining ACE inhibitorswith any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.Nancy Ross-Flanigan
Angiotensin-convertingenzyme test
Definition
This test measures blood levels of angiotensin-con-verting enzyme (ACE), also known as Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (SASE). The primary function ofKEY TERMS
Arteries—Blood vessels that carry blood awayfrom the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs ofthe body.Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lastingcondition. Chronic conditions often develop grad-ually and involve slow changes.Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.Scleroderma—A disease that first affects the skinand later affects certain internal organs. The firstsymptoms are the hardening, thickening, andshrinking of the skin.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—A chronicdisease that affects the skin, joints, and certaininternal organs.Venom—A poisonous substance secreted by ananimal, usually delivered through a bite or a sting.ACE is to help regulate arterial pressure by convertingangiotensin I to angiotensin II.Purpose
The ACE test is used primarily to detect and monitorthe clinical course of sarcoidosis(a disease that affectsmany organs, especially the lungs), to differentiatebetween sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to delin-eate between active and inactive sarcoid disease. Elevat-ed ACE levels are also found in a number of other condi-tions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare familial disor-der of fat metabolism) and leprosy.
Precautions
It should be noted that people under 20 years of agenormally have very high ACE levels. Decreased levels maybe seen in the condition of excess fat in the blood (hyper-lipidemia). Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levelsinclude ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.
Description
ACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosteronemechanism which controls blood pressure by convertingangiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved inregulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac-tive, but when converted by ACE to the active form,angiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small bloodvessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres-sure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos-terone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer-tain kidney disorders increase the production ofangiotensin II, another cause of hypertension. Despite the action of ACE on blood pressure regulation, determi-nation of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluationof hypertension (high blood pressure).
Preparation
Determination of ACE levels requires a blood sam-ple. The patient need not be fasting.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may includeslight bleeding from the puncture site,faintingor feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (bloodaccumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for this test are laboratory-specificbut can range from 8-57 U/ml for patients over 20 yearsof age.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 205Angiotensin-converting enzyme testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 205Abnormal results
Serum ACE levels are elevated in approximately 80-90% of patients with active sarcoidosis.

Animal bite infections
Definition
The most common problem following an animal biteis simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is knownto contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to onerecent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up inabout 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it canthen transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor-ganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec-tion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis-comfort to life-threatening complications.
Description
Two to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year inthe United States and about 1% of bites require hospital-ization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency roomvisits per year, which represents approximately 1% of allemergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil-lion dollars in health care expenses and lost income.KEY TERMS
Sarcoidosis—Sarcoidosis is a rare disease ofunknown cause in which inflammation occurs inlymph nodes and other tissues throughout thebody, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men aremore often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereaswomen are more often bitten by cats (3:1).Dog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents.Cats account for about 10% of reported bites, and otheranimals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons,bats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5-10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently thandog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15-20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi-mately 30-50% of cat bites become infected.Many factors contribute to the infection rates, suchas, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the locationof the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bittenperson, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com-pliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound.Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because they haverounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adultdog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres-sure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury,causing damage to deep structures such as bones, bloodvessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teethare also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations.Cats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc-ture wounds. Puncture wounds appear innocuous on thesurface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teethessentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar-row wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impairedimmunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIVinfection—are especially vulnerable to infection.The bacterial species most commonly found in bitewounds include Pasteurella multocida,Staphylococcusaureus,Pseudomonas sp, and Streptococcus sp. P . multoci-da, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominentin cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animalbites include cat-scratch disease,tetanusand rabies.
Causes and symptoms
The most common sign of infection from an animalbite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is redand feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearbylymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise ifthe infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc-tures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurson the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely.Live, disease-causing bacteria within the blood-stream and tissues cause complications far from thewound site. Such complications include meningitis, brain abscesses,pneumoniaand lung abscesses, andheart infections, among others. These complications canbe fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 206Animal bite infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 206and bones, causing inflammation of the bone and bonemarrow or septic arthritis.Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella hense-lae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva; infectionmay be transmitted by a bite or scratch. Approximately22,000 cases are reported each year in the United States;worldwide, nine out of every 100,000 individualsbecome infected. More than 80% of reported cases occurin persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor-mally severe in individuals with healthy immune sys-tems. Symptoms may become serious, however, inimmunocompromised individuals, such as those withacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those undergoing chemotherapy. Common symptoms includean inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch,swollen lymph nodes,fever,fatigue, and rash.Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted throughthe bite of an animal that is already infected. More than90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such asskunks, bats, and raccoons, with domestic animals such asdogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) estimates that between35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year asa result of rabies. The highest incidence of rabies occurs inAsia where, in 1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, mostoccurring in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the U.S. dueto good animal control practice. The delay of onset is usu-ally weeks to months after being bitten. Early symptomsof rabies include fever,headache, and flu-like symptoms.These progress to anxiety,hallucinations, muscle spasms, partial paralysis, fear of water (hydrophobia), andother neurological symptoms as the virus spreads to thecentral nervous system. Medical treatment must be soughtsoon after exposure because deathinvariably follows oncethe infection becomes established.
Diagnosis
A medical examination involves taking the history ofthe injury and assessing the wound type and damage.Tetanus immunization and general health status arechecked. An x ray may be ordered to assess bone damageand to check for foreign objectsin the wound. Woundcultures are done for infected bites if the victim is at highrisk for complications or if the infection does not respondto treatment. Evaluation of possible exposure to rabies isalso important. A biting animal suspected of having rabiesis usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a periodof time for evidence of pre-existing infection.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the wound type, its site, andrisk factors for infection. All wounds are cleaned and dis-infected as thoroughly as possible. Bites to the head andface usually receive sutures, as do severe lacerationselsewhere. Puncture wounds are left open. If abscessfor- mation occurs, the physician may perform an incision soas to drain the abscess.If infection occurs,antibioticsare prescribed.Antibiotics may also be used for infection prevention.Since a single bite wound may contain many differenttypes of bacteria, no single antibiotic is always effective.Commonly prescribed antibiotics are penicillin or a com-bination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.Because rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics arenot effective. In addition, as of 2001, there is no knowncure for the disease once symptoms become apparent. Itis therefore recommended that individuals with a highrisk of contracting the disease (veterinarians, animal han-dlers, some laboratory workers) receive preexposure vac-

The PEPregimen consists of one vaccine given at the initial visitas well as one dose of human immune globulin. Addi-tional vaccines given on days 3, 7, 14, and 28.
Prognosis
Once a bacterial infection is halted, the bite victim usu-ally recovers fully. There is no known cure for rabies oncesymptoms become evident and death is almost certain.WHO reports that 114 rabies deaths occurred in the Americ-as in 1997, with only four deaths occurring that year in theUnited States, thus emphasizing the importance of goodanimal control practice and postexposure prophylaxis.
Prevention

Ankylosing spondylitis
Definition
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) refers to inflammationof the joints in the spine. AS is also known as rheumatoidspondylitis or Marie-Strümpell disease (among othernames).
Description
A form of arthritis, AS is characterized by chronicinflammation, causing painand stiffness of the back,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 208Ankylosing spondylitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 208progressing to the chest and neck. Eventually, the wholeback may become curved and inflexible if the bones fuse(this is known as “bamboo spine”). AS is a systemic dis-order that may involve multiple organs, such as the:• eye (causing an inflammation of the iris, or iritis)• heart (causing aortic valve disease)• lungs• skin (causing a scaly skin condition, or psoriasis)• gastrointestinal tract (causing inflammation within thesmall intestine, called ileitis, or inflammation of thelarge intestine, called colitis)Less than 1% of the population has AS; however,20% of AS sufferers have a relative with the disorder.
Causes and symptoms
Genetics play an important role in the disease, butthe cause of AS is still unknown. More than 90% ofpatients have a gene called HLA-B27, but only 10-15%of those who inherit the gene develop the disease. Symp-toms of AS include:• low back and hip pain and stiffness• difficulty expanding the chest• pain in the neck, shoulders, knees, and ankles• low-grade fever• fatigue• weight lossAS is seen most commonly in males 30 years oldand older. Initial symptoms are uncommon after the ageof 30, although the diagnosis may not be establisheduntil after that age. The incidence of AS in Afro-Ameri-cans is about 25% of the incidence in Caucasians.
Diagnosis
Doctors usually diagnose the disease simply by thepatient’s report of pain and stiffness. Doctors also reviewspinal and pelvic x rays since involvement of the hip andpelvic joints is common and may be the first abnormalityseen on the x ray. The doctor may also order a blood testto determine the presence of HLA-B27 antigen. When adiagnosis is made, patients may be referred to a rheuma-tologist, a doctor who specializes in treating arthritis.Patients may also be referred to an orthopedic surgeon, adoctor who can surgically correct joint or bone disorders.
Treatment
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs),like naproxen (Naprosyn) or indomethacin (Indocin) areused to relieve pain and stiffness. In severe cases, sul-fasalazine (Azulfidine), another drug to reduce inflam-mation, or methotrexate (Rheumatrex), an immune-sup-pressing drug, is recommended. In cases where chronictherapy is needed, potential drug side effects must betaken into consideration. Corticosteroid drugs are effec-tive in relieving symptoms, but are usually reserved forsevere cases that do not improve when NSAIDs are used.To avoid potential side effects, treatment with corticos- teroidsis usually limited to a short amount of time witha gradual weaning from the drug.Physical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent astooped posture and breathing problems when the spinestarts to fuse and ribs are affected. Back braces may beused to prevent continued deformity of the spine andribs. Only in severe cases of deformity is surgery per-formed to straighten and realign the spine, or to replaceknee, shoulder, or hip joints.Alternative treatment
To reduce inflammation various herbal remedies,including white willow (Salix alba), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and lobelia (Lobelia inflata), may be help-ful. Acupuncture, performed by a trained professional,has helped some patients manage their pain. Homeopath-ic practitioners may prescribe such remedies as Bryonia and Rhus toxicodendronfor pain relief.
Prognosis
There is no cure for AS, and the course of the diseaseis unpredictable. Generally, AS progresses for about 10years and then its progression levels off. Most patientscan lead normal lives with treatment to control symptoms.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent AS.Resources

Anorectal disorders
Definition
Anorectal disorders are a group of medical disordersthat occur at the junction of the anal canal and the rec-tum.
Description
The anal canal, also called the anus, is the opening atthe bottom end of the digestive tract and is a combinationof external skin and tissue from the digestive tract. It hasmany sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain. The rectumis the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucuslayer as its inside surface. It has very few sensory nervesand is, therefore, relatively insensitive to pain. The analcanal has a ring of muscle, called the anal sphincter,which keeps the anus closed. There are a number of dif-ferent anorectal disorders.KEY TERMS
Ankylosing—When bones of a joint are fused,stiff, or rigid.HLA-B27—An antigen or protein marker on cellsthat may indicate ankylosing spondylitis.Immune suppressing—Anything that reduces theactivity of the immune system.Inflammation—A reaction of tissues to disease orinjury, often associated with pain and swelling.Spondylitis—An inflammation of the spine.Causes and symptoms
Hemorrhoidsare swollen or varicose veinsin the anal canal and rectum. They may become inflamed,enlarged, or protrude from the anorectal area. Hemor-rhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement. Theamount of bleeding is typically small. Frequently, hem-orrhoids develop because of straining during bowelmovements, especially if the person has constipation. An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus thatis usually caused by a hard bowel movement. Fissuresare painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed duringbowel movements.Anorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-form-ing infections in the anorectal region. Painful abscessesform under the skin.An anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan-nel from the anorectal area to another part of the body.Typically, the channel leads to pockets of skin near theanus. When seen in infants, anorectal fistulas are consid-ered birth defects. These are seen more frequently inboys than in girls. Fistulas are also seen more frequentlyin people who have other diseases, including Crohn’s disease,tuberculosis,cancer, and diverticulitis. Anorec-tal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses orother injury to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painfuland discharge pus.Proctitisis an inflammation of the internal mucosallining of the rectum. Ulcers of the lining may form anddevelop into ulcerative colitis. There are many causes ofproctitis, including the sexually transmitted diseaseschlamydia and herpes simplex infections. Proctitis is fre-quently seen in homosexual males as a consequence ofanorectal infection. Proctitis itself is not painful, but painmay be caused by the infectious agent.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skinaround the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the rectumwith a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short instrumentthat allows the physician to view the inside of the anus. Aproctoscope is a longer, rigid viewing tube of approxi-mately six to ten inches in length, which may be used tolook for anorectal disorders. A sigmoidoscope is alonger, flexible tube, that allows the physician to view upto about two feet of the inside of the large intestine. Tis-sue samples and material for microbial culture may beobtained during the examination.
Treatment
Treatment usually isn’t required for hemorrhoids.Most hemorrhoids will heal if the patient takes stool soft-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 210Anorectal disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 210eners to relieve the constipation. Enlarged blood vesselscan be eliminated by surgery if they are considered asevere problem. In the case of fissures, treatmentinvolves stool softeners that eliminate stresson the fis-sure during bowel movements, which allows the fissureto heal. If the fissure doesn’t heal, surgery is required.Treatment for anorectal abscesses consists of cutting theabscessand draining the pus. Fistulas are treated bysurgery.The usual treatment for proctitis is antibiotics. Resources

Anorexia nervosa
Definition
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterizedby unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation, andconspicuous distortion of body image. The name comesfrom two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat.In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia ner-vosa is usually marked by amenorrhea, or skipping atleast three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth editionof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-orders, or DSM-IV(1994), defines two subtypes ofanorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized bystrict dieting and exercisewithout binge eating; and abinge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com-pulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting andthe use of laxativesor enemas. DSM-IVdefines a bingeas a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode ofcompulsive eating in which the individual consumes asignificantly larger amount of food than most peoplewould eat in similar circumstances.
Description
Anorexia nervosa was not officially classified as apsychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSMin1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles-cent females. Its incidence in the United States has dou-bled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported casesreflects a genuine increase in the number of personsaffected by the disorder, and not simply earlier or moreaccurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex-ia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female adoles-cents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorderas of 1998 are female. It was originally thought that only5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is beingrevised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis-order is 14-18 years, although there are patients whodevelop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s and1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- andmiddle-class women, but that generalization is alsochanging. More recent studies indicate that anorexia isincreasingly common among women of all races andsocial classes in the United States.Anorexia nervosa is a serious public health problemnot only because of its rising incidence, but also becauseit has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatricdisorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious long-term health complications, including congestive heart failure, sudden death, growth retardation, dental prob-lems,constipation, stomach rupture, swelling of thesalivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of theblood, loss of kidney function, and osteoporosis.
Causes and symptoms
Anorexia is a disorder that results from the interac-tion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biologicalfactors. While the precise cause of the disease is notknown, it has been linked to the following:Social influencesThe rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflectthe present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper-class status as well as of female beauty. In addition, theincrease in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav-ior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi-tating other girls.The onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed toa developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodiescoupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks.The increasing influence of the mass media in spreadingand reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted.Occupational goalsThe risk of developing anorexia is higher amongadolescents preparing for careers that require attention toweight and/or appearance. These high-risk groups
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 211Anorectal disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 211include dancers, fashion models, professional athletes(including gymnasts, skaters, long-distance runners, andjockeys), and actresses.Genetic and biological influencesWomen whose biological mothers or sisters have thedisorder appear to be at increased risk.Psychological factorsA number of theories have been advanced to explainthe psychological aspects of the disorder. No singleexplanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has beeninterpreted as:• A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection isvariously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or asa desire to resemble men as closely as possible.• A reaction to sexual abuseor assault.• A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos-sible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female pas-sivity and weakness are attractive to men.• Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen-dence. Some anorexics come from achievement-orient-ed families that stressphysical fitness and dieting.Many anorexics are perfectionistic and “driven” aboutschoolwork and other matters in addition to weightcontrol.• Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, adaughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction frommarital discord or other family tensions.• Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu-rately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding.Male anorexicsAlthough anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis-order that largely affects women, its incidence in themale population is rising. Less is known about the causesof anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the sameas for females. These include certain occupational goalsand increasing media emphasis on external appearance inmen. Moreover, homosexual males are under pressure toconform to an ideal body weight that is about 20 poundslighter than the standard “attractive” weight for hetero-sexual males.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by anumber of factors. One is that the disorder varies some-what in severity from patient to patient. A second factoris denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor-der. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usuallybrought to treatment by a family member.Most anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians orfamily practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod-ies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low bloodpressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (fail-ure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdomi-nal pain, constipation, or lack of energy. The patient mayfeel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downybody hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may haveeroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the backof the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure-ment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IVspecifies aweight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal,with some allowance for body build and weight history.The doctor will need to rule out other physical condi-tions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating,including metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especiallyhypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of thedigestive tract, and a condition called superior mesentericartery syndrome. Persons with this condition sometimesvomit after meals because the blood supply to the intes-tine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood tests,an electrocardiogram,urinalysis, and bone densitometry(bone density test) in order to exclude other diseases andto assess the patient’s nutritional status.The doctor will also need to distinguish betweenanorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including depres-sion,schizophrenia, social phobia,obsessive-compulsivedisorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Two diagnostictests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes Test(EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).Treatment
Treatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short-and long-term measures, and requires assessment bydietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists.Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s resistanceor failure to carry out treatment plan.Hospital treatmentHospitalization is recommended for anorexics withany of the following characteristics:• weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight lossover a three-month period of more than 30 pounds• severely disturbed metabolism• severe binging and purging• signs of psychosis• severe depression or risk of suicide• family in crisis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 212Anorectal disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 212Hospital treatment includes individual and group therapyas well as refeeding and monitoring of thepatient’s physical condition. Treatment usually requirestwo to four months in the hospital. In extreme cases, hos-pitalized patients may be force-fed through a tube insert-ed in the nose (nasogastric tube) or by over-feeding(hyperalimentation techniques).Outpatient treatmentAnorexics who are not severely malnourished can betreated by outpatient psychotherapy. The types of treat-ment recommended are supportive rather than insight-ori-ented, and include behavioral approaches as well as indi-vidual or group therapy. Family therapyis often recom-mended when the patient’s eating disorder is closely tiedto family dysfunction. Self-help groups are often useful inhelping anorexics find social support and encouragement.Psychotherapy with anorexics is a slow and difficultprocess; about 50% of patients continue to have seriouspsychiatric problems after their weight has stabilized.MedicationsAnorexics have been treated with a variety of med-ications, including antidepressants,antianxiety drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and lithiumcarbonate. The effectiveness of medications in treatmentregimens is still debated. However, at least one study ofProzac showed it helped the patient maintain weightgained while in the hospital.
Prognosis
Figures for long-term recovery vary from study tostudy, but the most reliable estimates are that 40-60% ofanorexics will make a good physical and social recovery,and 75% will gain weight. The long-term mortality ratefor anorexia is estimated at around 10%, although somestudies give a lower figure of 3-4%. The most frequentcauses of death associated with anorexia are starvation, electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, and suicide.
Prevention
Short of major long-term changes in the larger soci-ety, the best strategy for prevention of anorexia is the cul-tivation of healthy attitudes toward food, weight control,and beauty (or body image) within families.Resources

Anoscopy
Definition
An anoscopy is an examination of the rectum inwhich a small tube is inserted into the anus to screen, diag-nose, and evaluate problems of the anus and anal canal.
Purpose
This test may be ordered for the evaluation of peri-anal or anal pain,hemorrhoids,rectal prolapse, digital rectal examinationthat shows a mass, perianal abscess and condyloma (a wart-like growth). An anascopy maybe performed to check for abnormal openings betweenthe anus and the skin, or anal fissures. The test is alsoused to diagnose rectal cancer.
Precautions
Anoscopy should not be performed on patients withacute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reac-tion it may cause. This test is also not recommended forpatients with acute abdominal problems and those with aconstricted or narrowed anal canal.
Description
Anoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using ananoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped specu-lum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope. Beforethe anoscope is used, the doctor completes a digital rectalexamination with a lubricated, gloved index finger. Theanoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a fewinches into the rectum. This procedure enlarges the rec-tum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal witha light. If any suspicious areas are noticed, a piece of tis-sue can be biopsied.During the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel-ing of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom. If abiopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch. Theprocedure is performed on an out-patient basis, and takesapproximately an hour to complete.
Preparation
The patient will be instructed to clear their rectum ofstool before the procedure. This may be done by taking aKEY TERMS
Anal fissure—An ulcer on the margin of the anus.Digital rectal examination—An examinationwhere a gloved, lubricated index finger is insertedinto the rectum to check for any abnormalities.Polyps—A tumor with a small flap that attachesitself to the wall of various vascular organs such asthe nose, uterus and rectum. Polyps bleed easily,and if they are suspected to be cancerous theyshould be surgically removed.Vasovagal reaction—Regarding the action of stim-uli from the vagus nerve on blood vessels.laxative, enema, or other preparation that may help withthe evacuation.
Aftercare
If a biopsy is needed during an anoscopy, there maybe slight anal bleeding for less than two days followingthe procedure. The patient may be instructed to sit in abathtub of warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, three times aday, to help decrease the pain and swelling.
Risks
A simple anoscopy procedure offers minimal risks.There is a limited risk of bleeding and mild pain is abiopsy is performed.
Normal results
Normal values to look for during an anoscopyinclude an anal canal that appears healthy in size, color,and shape. The test also looks for no evidence of bleed-ing, polyps, hemorrhoids or other abnormalities.
Abnormal results
While an anoscopy is typically performed to deter-mine is hemorrhoids are present, other abnormal findingcould include polyps, abscesses, inflammation, fissures,colorectal polyps, or cancer.Resources

Anosmia
Definition
The term anosmia means lack of the sense of smell.It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. Ageusia, acompanion word, refers to a lack of taste sensation.Patients who actually have anosmia may complainwrongly of ageusia, although they retain the ability todistinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter—humans’ onlytaste sensations.
Description
Of the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importancefor humans, although it is much more pronounced inother animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell anodor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste, consid-ered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food in themouth. The sense of smell originates from the first cranialnerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at the base of thebrain’s frontal lobes, right behind the eyes and above thenose. Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves.There are other aberrations of smell beside adecrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or halluci-nated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction ofthe brain.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu-sion caused by rhinitis(inflammation of the nasal mem-branes). If no air gets to the olfactory nerves, smell willnot happen. In turn, rhinitis and nasal polyps(growths on nasal membranes) are caused by irritants such asallergens, infections, cigarette smoke, and other air pol-lutants. Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block thenasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anos-mia. Head injuryor, rarely, certain viral infections candamage or destroy the olfactory nerves.Diagnosis
It is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no onecomplains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a physi-cian usually begins by testing each nostril separatelywith a common, non-irritating odor such as perfume,lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis are obviouscausal agents a physician looks for. Imaging studies ofthe head may be necessary in order to detect brain injury,sinus infection, or tumor.
Treatment
Cessation of smokingis the first step. Many smok-ers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically thatthey immediately gain weight. Attention to reducingexposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respira-tory allergiesor chronic upper respiratory infections willbe beneficial. Corticosteroidsare particularly helpful.
Alternative treatment
Finding and treating the cause of the loss of smell isthe first approach in naturopathic medicine. If rhinitisis the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cellstabilizers and herbal decongestantscan offer somerelief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present, thisis often related to an environmental irritant or to foodallergies. Removal of the causative factors is the first stepto healing. Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief ofthe blockage and tonification of the membranes. Block-ages can sometimes be resolved through naso-specifictherapy—a way of realigning the nasal cavities. Polypblockage can be addressed through botanical medicinetreatment as well as hydrotherapy. Olfactory nervedamage may not be regenerable. Some olfactory aberra-tions, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolvedusing homeopathic medicine.
Prognosis
If nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, thechances of recovery are excellent. However, if nervedamage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of smellis much more difficult.Resources

Anoxemia seeAnoxia
Anoxia
Definition
Anoxia is a condition characterized by an absence ofoxygen supply to an organ or a tissue.
Description
Anoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered toa part of the body. If the condition does not involve totaloxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia, althoughthe two terms have been used interchangeably. A relatedcondition, anoxemia, occurs when the blood circulatesbut contains a below normal amount of oxygen.The five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox-emic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic. Hypox-emic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outsidethe body is so low that the hemoglobin, the chemicalwhich carries oxygen in the red blood cells (RBCs), isunable to become fully loaded with the gas. This results intoo little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suf-focation when a person is at high altitude, where the pres-sure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level.Anemic anoxia results from a decrease in theamount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, whichreduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemiamay result from lack of production of red blood cellsKEY TERMS
Allergen—Any substance that irritates only thosewho are sensitive (allergic) to it.Corticosteroids—Cortisone, prednisone, andrelated drugs that reduce inflammation.Rhinitis—Inflammation and swelling of the nasalmembranes.Nasal polyps—Drop-shaped overgrowths of thenasal membranes.(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortenedlifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).Affinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry ofthe blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick upas much oxygen from the air, even though the quantitiesare normal, reducing how much is delivered to the tissues.Stagnant anoxia occurs when there is interferencewith the blood flow, although the blood and its oxygen-carrying abilities are normal. A common cause of generalstagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with thereturn of blood flow through the veins. Examples of localstagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases thatrestrict circulation to the extremities, and ergot poison- ing. When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced abilityto accept and use the oxygen, it is called histotoxic anox-ia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where thechemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for thecell to use oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide can-not use the oxygen even though it is in normal amountsin the bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be causedby exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, ace-tone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.
Causes and symptoms
Anoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number ofdisease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulationincluding heart attack, severe asthma, or emphysema. It can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhala-tion, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning, strangu-lation,near-drowning, or high altitude exposure throughmountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressur-ized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain damage, is aparticular problem with newborns during difficult births.No matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptomsare similar. In severe cases, the patient is often confusedand commonly stuperous or comatose (in a state ofunconsciousness). Depending on the severity of the injuryto the brain, the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygenintake, this condition can persist for hours, days, weeks,or even months or years. Seizures, myoclonic jerks (invol-untary muscle spasms or twitches), and neck stiffness aresome other symptoms of the anoxic condition.Symptoms of more localized or less complete oxygendeprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing rate,lightheadedness,dizziness, tingling or warm sensation,sweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a bluish tintto skin, particularly the fingertips and lips, and behaviorchanges, often an inappropriate sense of euphoria.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly madethrough the appearance of clinical symptoms. However,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 216AnoxiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 216suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the tissues can beconfirmed using laboratory tests. The exact test that isperformed is dependent on the suspected cause of theanoxia. One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is theserum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced toproduce energy without oxygen, as would happen duringanoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, anincrease in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis-sues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygenpathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con-tains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, someforms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrationsin the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels arenot associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for thistest is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition.
Treatment
The exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on thecause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues. How-ever, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levelsthrough supplementing the patient’s air supply with100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary stepsoften include support of the cardiovascular systemthrough drugs or other treatment, treatment of lung dis-ease, transfusions, or administration of anecdotes for poi-soning, as appropriate.
Prognosis
A good prognosis is dependent on the ability to treatthe underlying cause of the low oxygen levels. If cardio-vascular and respiratory systems can be supported ade-quately, recovery from the injury to the tissue is possible,although extent of injury to the brain can be difficult toassess. The exact amount of recovery varies with theamount of injury sustained, where significant injury bringsa poorer prognosis. As recovery occurs, both psychologi-cal and neurological abnormalities may appear, persist,and can improve. Some problems seen after anoxiainclude mental confusion, personality changes, amnesia or other types of memory loss,hallucinations, and persis-tent myoclonus (involuntary contractions of the muscles).
Prevention
Hypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing sup-plemental oxygen when in high altitudes and beingaware of the early symptoms of altitude sicknessand reducing altitude once recognized. Iron supplements canavoid anemic hypoxia, although more severe anemicstates are usually caused by disease or bleeding. Main-taining good cardiovascular health through proper dietand exerciseis a good first step to avoiding the mostKEY TERMS

Antacids
Definition
Antacids are medicines that neutralize stomach acid.
Purpose
Antacids are used to relieve acid indigestion, upset stomach, sour stomach, and heartburn. Additional com-ponents of some formulations include dimethicone, to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 217AntacidsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 217reduce gas pains (flatulence) and alginic acid, which, incombination with antacids, may help manage GERD(gastro-esophageal reflux disease). Antacids should notbe confused with gastric acid inhibitors, such as the H-2receptor blockers (cimetidine, ranitide and others) or theproton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, omeprazole andothers). Although all three classes of drugs act to reducethe levels of gastric acid, their mechanisms are different,and this affects the appropriate use of the drug. Antacidshave a rapid onset and short duration of action, and aremost appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort fora short period of time.Antacids may be divided into two classes, those thatwork by chemical neutralization of gastric acid, mostnotably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act byadsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids), such ascalcium and magnesium salts.The chemical antacids show the most rapid onset ofaction, but may cause “acid rebound,” a condition inwhich the gastric acid returns in greater concentrationafter the drug effect has stopped. Also, since theseantacids may contain high concentrations of sodium,they may be inappropriate in patients with hypertension. Calcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption ofthe acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect, butmay have other significant disadvantages. Theseantacids are particularly prone to drug interactions, andpatients taking other medications must often avoidsimultaneous administration of the medications. Theseantacids are more effective in liquid formulations thanin tablet or capsule form, and so may be inconvenientfor routine dosing.The non-absorbable antacids may have additionaluses beyond control of hyperacidity. Calcium salts maybe used as diet supplements in prevention of osteoporo-sis. Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate,and has been effective in treatment and control of hyper-phosphatemia or for use with a low phosphate diet to pre-vent formation of phosphate urinary stones. This applica-tion is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renalfailure. Antacids with aluminum and magnesium hydrox-ides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively preventsignificant stressulcer bleeding in post-operativepatients or those with severe burns.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the type of antacid. Consultspecific references.When using antacids in chewable tablet form, chewthe tablet well before swallowing. Drink a glass of waterafter taking chewable aluminum hydroxide. Lozengesshould be allowed to dissolve completely in the mouth.Liquid antacids should be shaken well before using.Precautions
Antacids should be avoided if any signs of appen- dicitisor inflamed bowel are present. These includecramping,pain, and soreness in the lower abdomen,bloating, and nausea and vomiting.Antacids may affect the results of some medicaltests, such as those that measure how much acid thestomach produces. Health care providers and patientsshould keep this in mind when scheduling a medical test.Antacids that contain magnesium may cause diar- rhea. Other types of antacids may cause constipation. Avoid taking antacids containing sodium bicarbon-ate when the stomach is uncomfortably full from eatingor drinking.Antacids should not be given to children under sixyears of age.Antacids that contain calcium or sodium bicarbonatemay cause side effects, such as dizziness, nausea, andvomiting, in people who consume large amounts of calci-um (from dairy products or calcium supplements). Insome cases, this can lead to permanent kidney damage.Before combining antacids with extra calcium, checkwith a physician.Some antacids contain large amounts of sodium,particularly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Anyonewho is on a low-sodium diet should check the list ofingredients or check with a physician or pharmacistbefore taking an antacid product.Excessive use of antacids may cause or increase theseverity or kidney problems. Calcium based antacidsmay lead to renal stone formation.
ALLERGIES. Allergiesto antacids are extremely rare,however the inactive ingredients in some formulationsmay include dyes or other products with allergic poten-tial.
PREGNANCY. Antacids are not classified under thepregnancysafety categories A, B, C, D and X. Occa-sional use of antacids in small amounts during pregnancyis considered safe. However, pregnant women shouldcheck with their physicians before using antacids or anyother medicines. Pregnant women who are consumingextra calcium should be aware that using antacids thatcontain sodium bicarbonate or calcium can lead to seri-ous side effects.
BREASTFEEDING. Some antacids may pass intobreast milk. However, no evidence exists that the inges-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 218AntacidsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 218tion of antacids through breast milk causes problems fornursing babies whose mothers use antacids occasionally.
Side effects
Side effects are very rare when antacids are taken asdirected. They are more likely when the medicine istaken in large doses or over a long time. Minor sideeffects include a chalky taste, mild constipation or diar-rhea, thirst, stomach cramps, and whitish or speckledstools. These symptoms do not need medical attentionunless they do not go away or they interfere with normalactivities.Other uncommon side effects may occur. Anyonewho has unusual symptoms after taking antacids shouldget in touch with his or her health care provider.
Interactions
Antacids have multiple drug interactions, usuallydue to inhibition of absorption of other medications. Inrare cases, the absorbable antacids may alter the pH ofthe stomach contents or urine sufficiently to alter drugabsoprtion or excretion. Consult specific references.Samuel Uretsky, PharmD

Definition
Antenatal testing includes any diagnostic proceduresperformed before the birth of a baby.
Purpose
These tests and exams are essential for protectingthe health of a pregnant woman and her developing child.
Precautions
Some tests, such as amniocentisis, carry a small riskof a miscarriageor other complications that could harmthe mother or baby.
Description
Women who become pregnant undergo a wide vari-ety of tests throughout the nine months before delivery.In the early stages, physicians order blood tests to screenfor possible disorders or infections, such as humanimmunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), which can pass from themother to the fetus. Later, the focus shifts to checking onfetal well-being with a variety of technological toolssuch as ultrasound scans. Descriptions of the most com-mon tests and procedures used during pregnancyare listed below.When a woman first learns she is pregnant, herphysician will run a series of routine urine and bloodtests to determine her blood type, check for anemia andgestational diabetes, make sure she is immune to rubel- la(German measles) and check for infectious diseaseslike HIV , hepatitis, chlamydia or syphilis. Physiciansalso usually do pelvic examto screen for cervical can-cerand check the patient’s blood pressure. As the preg-nancy progresses, more tests will follow.UltrasoundUltrasound is a device that records sound waves asthey bounce off the developing fetus to create an image,which is projected onto a large computer screen. Physi-cians order an ultrasound scan to listen for a fetal heart-beat, determine a woman’s precise due date and check fortwins, among other uses. An ultrasound scan also is knownas a sonogram. The procedure takes a few minutes, is pain-less and usually is covered by health insurance.The ultrasound technician will ask the pregnantwoman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.The technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stom-ach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 219Antenatal testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 219waves better. In certain cases, the technician may insert aplastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get aclearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the testmay need to be done with a full bladder.Unlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during preg-nancy. It does not cause any known side-effects thatwould harm the mother or baby.Pregnant women usually will have their first ultra-sound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. Innormal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetalheartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the screen.Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to makesure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birthcanal head first.Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus hasstopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed withouta fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later in pregnan-cy, it also may show that the child is in a breech position,oriented feet first, which can cause a difficult labor.Tests for birth defectsMost obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways tofind out if their developing child might have birth defectssuch as spina bifidaand Down Syndrome. An alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simpleblood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their childwill have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works bymeasuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance pro-duced by a fetus with birth defects. Low levels of alphafetoprotein in the mother’s blood may indicate Down’sSyndrome. In that case, the next step for most couples isamniocentesisbecause the alpha fetoprotein test cangive false-positive results. Amniocentesis is a more accu-rate test, but it also has higher risks of complications.This procedure typically is used to diagnose Downsyndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,at 15-28 weeks.During amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needlethrough a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix.Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the uterusto withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac.Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied inthe laboratory. Scientists can analyze DNA samples todetermine if the fetus has Down syndrome or othergenetic conditions. Amniocentesis also can determine thesex of the fetus.Women who have a history of recurring miscar-riages may not want to have this procedure.Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’soffice on an outpatient basis.Common side effects include cramping and bleeding.In about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesiscauses a needle to puncture the uterine wall, which couldresult in miscarriage.In most cases, couples find out their baby does nothave a birth defect.If the results come back positive for Down’s Syn-drome or other serious conditions, the couple mustdecide if they want to end the pregnancy. Others use theknowledge to plan and prepare any special care neededfor their future child.Group B StrepThis test is for Group B streptococci (GBS) infection.By testing for GBS, physicians can determine if awoman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child.Women who have had a prior child with GBS, orwho have a feveror prolonged or premature rupture ofthe amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type ofinfection.GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in thevagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat, GBS can be present in a person’s body without causing anysymptoms, so many women do not realize they areinfected with it.To test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take aurine sample. They also may collect samples from thevagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab. Thistest is usually performed late in pregnancy, at 35-37weeks of gestation.This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with noside effects.In many cases, doctors do not find any evidence ofthis type of infection.If a woman is found to be infected with Group Bstrep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just beforelabor begins. At that time, they may give the motherantibioticsso the baby is not born with the infection.Newborns who are exposed to Group B strep can haveinflammation of the brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs.In some cases, this serious complication can result ininfant death.Resources

Antepartum testing
Definition
Antepartum testing consists of a variety of tests per-formed late in pregnancyto verify fetal well-being, asjudged by the baby’s heart rate and other characteristics.Antepartum tests include the nonstress test (NST), bio-physical profile, and contraction stress test(CST).
Purpose
Antepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks ofpregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can beKEY TERMS
Ultrasound—A device that records sound wavesas they bounce off a developing fetus to create animage, which is projected onto a large computerscreenBreech position—When a child is oriented feetfirst in the mother’s uterus just before delivery.Alpha fetoprotein screen—A test that measures thelevel of alpha fetoprotein, a substance produced bya fetus with birth defects, in the mother’s blood.Amniocentesis—An invasive procedure thatallows physicians to check for birth defects by col-lecting a sample of fetal cells from inside theamniotic sac.GBS—Group B streptococci are a type of bacteriathat, if passed to a can cause inflammation of thebrain, spinal cord, blood or lungs. In some cases,it can result in infant deathwarned of any problems that may necessitate further test-ing or immediate delivery. The results reflect the adequa-cy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the fetus fromthe placenta.Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies athigh risk for fetal complications. Various reasonsinclude:• any chronic illness in the mother, such as high bloodpressure or diabetes• problems with previous pregnancies, such as stillbirth• fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retar-dation(a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth defects• problems in the current pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood pres-sure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, prema-ture rupture of the membranes, excessive amniotic fluid(the liquid that surrounds the fetus), vaginal bleeding,or placenta previa(a condition in which the placenta ispositioned over the cervix instead of near the top of theuterus)• twins or other multiple fetusesOne of the most common indications for antepartumtesting is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy should notbe allowed to continue past 42 weeks. (The usual preg-nancy is 40 weeks in duration). Babies should be moni-tored with antepartum testing starting at 41 weeks. After41 weeks, there is an increasing risk that the placentacannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen andnutrition. This may be reflected in decreased move-ments of the baby, decreased amniotic fluid, and changesin the heart rate pattern of the baby.
Description
TechnologyThe NST and CST use a technique called electronicfetal monitoringto evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus.The biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination.NSTThe NST is usually the first antepartum test used toverify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle thatwhen the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring accel-erations of the heart rate in response to the baby’s ownmovements, i.e., in the absence of stress.The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic fetalmonitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the fetalheart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on agraph or “tracing” to determine whether it demonstrates
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 221Antepartum testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 221correct reactivity, or acceleration of the heart rate. Torecord fetal movements on the tracing, the mother press-es a button every time she feels the baby move. If thebaby is inactive, the mother may be asked to rub herabdomen to “awaken” it. Sometimes an instrument isused to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus (vibroa-coustic stimulation). The test usually takes between20–45 minutes.A baby who is receiving enough oxygen shouldmove at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’sheart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute forat least 20 seconds during these movements. The NST isthe simplest and cheapest antepartum test.Biophysical profileThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam thatcan add additional information to the NST. During thebiophysical profile, the examiner checks for variouscharacteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall health.These include: fetal movement, fetal tone, breathingmovements, and the amniotic fluid volume. Amnioticfluid volume is important because a decreased amountraises the possibility that the baby may be under stress.The five components of the test (NST is also included)are each given a score of 2 for normal (or present), 1 ifdecreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possiblescore is 10. The “modified” biophysical profile isanother option; this includes only the NST and amnioticfluid volume.CSTThe CST is like the NST, except that the fetus isevaluated in response to contractions of the mother’suterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is oftenused after an abnormal NST to confirm the results. Uter-ine contractions produce “stress” in the fetus becausethey temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen. TheCST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond tothis stress by a decrease in the heart rate.The CST is performed with the same equipment asthe NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate arerecorded along with the onset, relative intensity, andduration of any spontaneous contractions. For an accu-rate test, the contractions should be of sufficient durationand frequency. If uterine activity does not occur natural-ly, a drug called oxytocin may be given to the motherintravenously (hence the test’s alternate name, the oxy-tocin challenge test) to provoke contractions. Anotheroption is self-stimulation of the mother’s nipples,because this releases natural oxytocin. The fetal heartrate is observed until, ideally, three moderate contrac-tions occur within 10 minutes.Preparation
The mother should eat just before the antepartumtests to help stimulate fetal activity.
Risks
There are no appreciable risks from the NST or thebiophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysicalprofile is painless and safe because it uses no harmfulradiation, and no evidence has been found that soundwaves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus.The frequency of antepartum testing depends on thereason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give incor-rect results, which may prompt an unnecessary earlydelivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important to dou-ble-check any abnormal findings.
Normal results
In general, “negative” or normal results on antepar-tum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthyand should remain so for perhaps a week, with no needfor immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the tests cannotguarantee that there are no problems, because falselynormal results can occur, though this is unusual. Even ifall test results are normal, it is important to realize thatthis does not guarantee a “perfect” baby.The NST is normal (“reactive”) if two or more dis-tinct fetal movements occur in association with appropri-ate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within 20 minutes.A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassur-ing. The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelera-tions in heart rate in response to three uterine contrac-tions within 10 minutes.
Abnormal results
A “positive” result suggests that the baby is notreceiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it isquite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal.To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder, follow-uptesting with the same or an alternate test will probably beperformed at least weekly.The NST is abnormal (“nonreactive”) if the fetalheart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per minuteat least two times during a 20-minute period. Abnormaldecreases in the heart rate (decelerations) are also a causefor concern.A biophysical profile score of 6 is considered acause for concern and should be followed by further test-ing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate deliveryof the fetus.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 222Antepartum testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 222Abnormal results on the CST include late decelera-tions, or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate after theuterine contractions. This can suggest that the baby is notreceiving enough oxygen and may have difficulty with-standing the stress of labor and vaginal delivery. Cesare- an sectionmight be necessary so the baby can be sparedthe stress of labor. With either NST or CST, a severedeceleration (a period of very slow heartbeat) can alsosuggest fetal distress.The ultimate outcome will depend on the woman’sindividual situation. In some cases, delivery can be post-poned while medication is given to the mother (e.g., forhigh blood pressure) or the fetus (e.g., to speed up lungmaturity before delivery). Depending upon the readinessof the mother’s cervix, the doctor may decide to inducelabor. The extra-large fetus of a diabetic woman mayrequire cesarean delivery; severe preeclampsia also maynecessitate induction of laboror cesarean section. Thedoctor will determine the most prudent course of action.Resources

Anthrax
Definition
Anthrax is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracisthat primarily affects livestock but that canoccasionally spread to humans, affecting either the skin,intestines, or lungs. In humans, the infection can often betreated, but it is almost always fatal in animals.
Description
Anthrax is most often found in the agriculturalareas of South and Central America, southern and east-ern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the MiddleEast. In the United States, anthrax is rarely reported,however, cases of animal infection with anthrax aremost often reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and itsassociated disease get their name from the Greek wordmeaning “coal” because of the characteristic coal-blacksore that is the hallmark of the most common form ofthe disease.During the 1800s, in England and Germany, anthraxwas known either as “wool-sorter’s” or “ragpicker’s” dis-ease because workers contracted the disease from bacter-ial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibers.Spores are the small, thick-walled dormant stage of somebacteria that enable them to survive for long periods oftime under adverse conditions. The first anthrax vaccinewas perfected in 1881 by Louis Pasteur.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 223AnthraxGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 223The largest outbreak ever recorded in the UnitedStates occurred in 1957 when nine employees of a goathair processing plant became ill after handling a contam-inated shipment from Pakistan. Four of the five patientswith the pulmonary form of the disease died. Other casesappeared in the 1970s when contaminated goatskindrumheads from Haiti were brought into this country assouvenirs. Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle,largely because of widespread animal vaccination. How- ever, some serious epidemics continue to occur amonganimal herds and in human settlements in developingcountries due to ineffective control programs.There has been a great deal of recent concern thatthe bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by somecountries as a type of biological warfare, since it is possi-ble to become infected simply by breathing in the spores.The largest-ever documented outbreak of human anthraxcontracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in1979, when anthrax spores were released from a militarylaboratory, causing a regional epidemic that killed 69 ofits 77 victims. Because the United States governmentconsiders anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, theDepartment of Defense has begun systematic vaccinationof all military personnel against anthrax, and othernations, such as Britain, are rapidly following suit.
Causes and symptoms
Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which produces spores that can remain dor-mant for years in soil and on animal products, such ashides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal tocattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and bonesare often heavily contaminated.Today, in humans, the disease is almost always anoccupational hazard, contracted by those who handleanimal hides (farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) orsort wool. It is also possible to become infected withanthrax by eating meat from contaminated animals.There are no reports of the disease spreading from oneperson to another.Symptoms vary depending on how the disease wascontracted, but the symptoms usually appear within oneweek of exposure.Cutaneous anthraxIn humans, anthrax usually occurs when the bacteriaenter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infec-tion at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this infection iscalled, is the mildest form of the disease. At first, thebacteria cause an itchy, raised area like an insect bite.Within one to two days, inflammation occurs around theraised area, and a blister forms around an area of dyingtissue that becomes black in the center. Other symptomsmay include shivering and chills. In most cases the bacte-ria remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to thenearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into thebloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi- soningthat rapidly proves fatal.Inhalation anthraxInhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to arare, fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary orinhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimesspreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-like symptoms, namely fever,fatigue,headache, and shortness of breath, but progresses to bronchitis, dur- ing which time it becomes difficult to breathe, and final-ly, the patient enters a state of shock. This rare form ofanthrax is usually fatal, even if treated within one or twodays after the symptoms appear.Intestinal anthraxIntestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the dis-ease, caused by eating meat from an animal that died ofanthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinalinflammation and sores or lesions (ulcers), much like thesores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form ofanthrax. The first signs of the disease are nausea andvomiting, loss of appetite, and fever, followed by abdomi-nal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe bloody diarrhea.
Diagnosis
Anthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracisin samples taken from blood,skin lesions, or respiratorysecretions. The bacteria may be positively identifiedusing biochemical methods or using a technique where-

Blood samples will also indicate ele-vated antibody levels or increased amounts of a proteinproduced directly in response to infection with theanthrax bacterium. Additional DNA-based tests are alsocurrently being perfected.
Treatment
In the early stages, anthrax is curable by administeringhigh doses of penicillin, but in the advanced stages, it canbe fatal. Other commonly used antibiotics, such as ery-thromycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, are also effec-tive, particularly for those individuals who are allergic topenicillin. Although not proven, it is thought that newerantibiotics, like ciprofloxacin and some cephalosporins, may also prove effective. Although cutaneous anthrax maybe cured following a single dose of antibiotic, it is impor-tant to continue treatment so as to avoid potential seriouscomplications, such as inflammation of the membranescovering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
Prognosis
Untreated anthrax is often fatal, but deathis far less likely with appropriate care. Ten to twenty percent ofpatients will die from anthrax of the skin (cutaneousanthrax) if it is not properly treated. All patients withinhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will die if untreated.Intestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75% of the time.
Prevention
Anthrax is relatively rare in the United Statesbecause of widespread animal vaccination and practicesused to disinfect hides or other animal products. Forthose in high-risk professions, an anthrax vaccine isavailable that is 93% effective in protecting against infec-tion. To provide this immunity, an individual must begiven an initial course of three injections, given twoweeks apart, followed by booster injections at 6, 12, and18 months and an annual immunization thereafter.Approximately 30% of those who have been vacci-nated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions,such as a slight tenderness at the injection site. Someonewho has already had anthrax might have a more severelocal reaction upon vaccination. Infrequently, there maybe a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of theforearm, and only a very few vaccine recipients mayhave a more general flu-like reaction to the shot.Other means of preventing the spread of infectioninclude carefully handling dead animals suspected ofhaving the disease and providing good ventilation whenprocessing hides, fur, wool, or hair.

Antiacne drugs
Definition
Antiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up pim-ples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe forms ofacne.
Purpose
Different types of antiacne drugs are used for differ-ent purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels, andcreams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may beused to clear up mild to moderately severe acne.Isotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for verysevere, disfiguring acne.Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores orhair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxymaterial, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles.Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair toform a protective coating, but when it cannot get out,small swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteriaand dead skin cells can also collect that can causeinflammation. Swellings that are small and notinflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When theybecome inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples thatfill with pus are called pustules.Acne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help clearthe skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildlyirritating the skin. This encourages skin cells to sloughoff, which helps open blocked pores. Benzoyl peroxidealso kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads andblackheads from turning into pimples. Isotretinoinshrinks the glands that produce sebum.Description
Benzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counteracne products that are applied to the skin, such asBenoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne, PanOxyl,and some formulations of Clean & Clear, Clearasil, andOxy. Some benzoyl peroxide products are available with-out a physician’s prescription; others require a prescrip-tion. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and comes in liquid, cream, and gelforms, which are applied to the skin. Isotretinoin (Accu-tane), which is taken by mouth in capsule form, is avail-able only with a physician’s prescription. Only physicianswho have experience in diagnosing and treating severeacne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofanti-acne drug. These drugs usually come with writtendirections for patients and should be used only as direct-ed. Patients who have questions about how to use themedicine should check with a physician or pharmacist.Patients who use isotretinoin usually take the medi-cine for a few months, then stop for at least two months.Their acne may continue to improve even after they stoptaking the medicine. If the condition is still severe afterseveral months of treatment and a two-month break, thephysician may prescribe a second course of treatment.
Precautions
IsotretinoinIsotretinoin can cause serious birth defects, includ- ing mental retardationand physical deformities. Thismedicine should not be used during pregnancy. Women who are able to bear children should not use isotretinoinunless they have very severe acne that has not cleared upwith the use of other anti-acne drugs. In that case, awoman who uses this drug must have a pregnancy testtwo weeks before beginning treatment and each monththey are taking the drug. Another pregnancy test must bedone one month after treatment ends. The woman mustuse an effective birth control method for one monthbefore treatment begins and must continue using itthroughout treatment and for one month after treatmentends. Women who are able to bear children and who wantto use this medicine should discuss this information withtheir health care providers. Before using the medicine,they will be asked to sign a consent form stating that theyunderstand the danger of taking isotretinoin during preg-nancy and that they agree to use effective birth control.Do not donate blood to a blood bank while takingisotretinoin or for 30 days after treatment with the drug
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 226Antiacne drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 226ends. This will help reduce the chance of a pregnantwoman receiving blood containing isotretinoin, whichcould cause birth defects.Isotretinoin may cause a sudden decrease in nightvision. If this happens, do not drive or do anything elsethat could be dangerous until vision returns to normal.Let the physician know about the problem.This medicine may also make the eyes, nose, andmouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eyedrops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve thedry mouth, chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarlesscandy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which comein liquid and tablet forms and are available without a pre-scription. If the problem continues for more than twoweeks, check with a physician or dentist. Mouth drynessthat continues over a long time may contribute to tooth decayand other dental problems.Isotretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.Patients being treated with this medicine should avoidexposure to the sun and should not use tanning beds, tan-ning booths, or sunlamps until they know how the drugaffects them.In the early stages of treatment with isotretinoin,some people’s acne seems to get worse before it startsgetting better. If the condition becomes much worse or ifthe skin is very irritated, check with the physician whoprescribed the medicine.Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoinWhen applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be carefulnot to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or inside ofthe nose. Do not put the medicine on skin that is windburned, sunburned, or irritated, and do not apply it toopen wounds.Because antiacne drugs such as benzoyl peroxideand tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing any-thing that might cause further irritation. Wash the facewith mild soap and water only two or three times a day,unless the physician says to wash it more often. Avoidusing abrasive soaps or cleansers and products that mightdry the skin or make it peel, such as medicated cosmet-ics, cleansers that contain alcohol, or other acne productsthat contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acid.If benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin make the skin toored or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with aphysician. Using the medicine less often or using aweaker strength may be necessary.Tretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight. Whilebeing treated with this medicine, avoid exposure to the sunand do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.If it is not possible to avoid being in the sun, use a sun-screen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 orwear protective clothing over the treated areas. The skinmay also become more sensitive to cold and wind. Peoplewho use this medicine should protect their skin from coldand wind until they know how the medicine affects them.Benzoyl peroxide may discolor hair or colored fab-rics.Special conditionsPeople who have certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines may have problems if theyuse antiacne drugs. Before using these products, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto etretinate, isotretinoin, tretinoin, vitamin A prepara-tions, or benzoyl peroxide in the past should let his or herphysician know before using an antiacne drug. Thephysician should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with a physician beforeusing tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Isotretinoin causesbirth defects in humans and must not be used duringpregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. No problems have been reportedin nursing babies whose mothers used tretinoin or ben-zoyl peroxide. Women who are breastfeeding babiesshould not take isotretinoin, however, as it may causeproblems in nursing babies.

Definition
Antiangina drugs are medicines that relieve thesymptoms of anginapectoris (severe chest pain).
Purpose
The dull, tight chest pain of angina occurs when theheart’s muscular wall is not getting enough oxygen. Byrelaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce theheart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen-rich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come indifferent forms, and are used in three main ways:• taken regularly over a long period, they reduce thenumber of angina attacks.• taken just before some activity that usually brings on anattack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.• taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain andpressure.Not every form of antiangina drug can be used inevery way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks thatare about to begin or to relieve attacks that have alreadystarted. These forms can be used only to reduce the num-ber of attacks. Be sure to understand how and when touse the type of antiangina drug that has been prescribed.
Description
Antiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come inmany different forms: tablets and capsules that are swal-lowed; tablets that are held under the tongue, inside thelip, or in the cheek until they dissolve; stick-on patches;ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays. Commonly usedantiangina drugs include isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil,Sorbitrate, and other brands) and nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual Spray, Nitrostat Tablets,Transderm-Nitro, and other brands). These medicines areavailable only with a physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type andform of antiangina drug and may be different for differ-ent patients. Check with the physician who prescribedthe drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription forthe correct dosage.Always take antiangina drugs exactly as directed.The medicine will not work if it is not taken correctly.Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-ing it for several weeks or more, as this could cause angi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 229Antiangina drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 229na attacks to return. If it is necessary to stop taking thedrug, check with the physician who prescribed it forinstructions on how to taper down gradually.
Precautions
Remember that some forms of antiangina drugswork too slowly to relieve attacks that have already start-ed. Check with the physician who prescribed the medi-cine for instructions on how to use the type that has beenprescribed. Patients who are using slower-acting forms tomake attacks less frequent may want to ask their physi-cians to prescribe a fast-acting type to relieve attacks.Another method of treating the frequency of attacks is toincrease the dosage of the long-acting antiangina drug.Do this only with the approval of a physician.These medicines make some people feel lighthead-ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lyingdown. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and holdonto something for support if possible. Antiangina drugsmay also cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintingin hot weather or when people stand for a long time orexercise. Use caution in all these situations. Drinkingalcohol while taking antiangina drugs may cause thesame problems. Anyone who takes this medicine shouldlimit the amount of alcohol consumed.Because these drugs may cause dizziness, be carefulwhen driving, using machines, or doing anything elsethat could be dangerous.If the person is taking the form of nitroglycerin thatis placed under the tongue and symptoms are not relievedwithin three doses taken about 5 minutes apart, the per-son should go to the hospital emergency room as soon aspossible. A heart attackmay be in progress.Some people develop tolerance to antiangina drugsover time. That is, the drug no longer produces thedesired effects. Anyone who seems to be developing atolerance to this medicine should check with his or herphysician.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antianginadrugs in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,or other substances.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or whomay become pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using antiangina drugs.Older people may be especially sensitive to theeffects of antiangina drugs and thus more likely to haveside effects such as dizziness and lightheadedness.Before using antiangina drugs, people with any ofthese medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:• recent heart attack or stroke• kidney disease• liver disease• severe anemia• overactive thyroid• glaucoma• recent head injury
Side effects
A common side effect is a headachejust after takinga dose of the medicine. These headaches usually becomeless noticeable as the body adjusts to the drug. Checkwith a physician if they are severe or they continue evenafter taking the medicine for a few weeks. Unless aphysician says to do so, do not change the dose to avoid

Antianxiety drugs
Definition
Antianxiety drugs are medicines that calm and relaxpeople with excessive anxiety, nervousness, or tension,or for short term control of social phobia disorder or spe-cific phobia disorder.
Purpose
Antianxiety agents, or anxiolytics, may be used totreat mild transient bouts of anxiety as well as more pro-nounced episodes of social phobia and specific phobia.Clinically significant anxiety is marked by severalKEY TERMS
Angina pectoris—A feeling of tightness, heavi-ness, or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxy-gen in the muscular wall of the heart.symptoms. The patient experiences marked or persistentfear of one or more social or performance situations inwhich he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or pos-sible scrutiny by others, and may react in a humiliatingor embarrassing way. The exposure to the feared situa-tion produces an anxiety attack. Fear of these episodesof anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairsnormal social functioning, including working or attend-ing classes. The patient is aware that these fears areunjustified.
Description
In psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety haslargely turned from traditional antianxiety agents, anxi-olytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current use, thebenzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics,have been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reup-take inhibitors (SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxam-ine and others) which have a milder side effect profileand less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxi-olytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onsetof action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety pro-voking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need forcontinued treatment. While SSRIs may require three tofive weeks to show any effects, and must be taken contin-uously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.The intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo-lam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriatechoice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia.Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, butits active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which has along half-life, may make this a poorer choice than otherdrugs in its class. Note that there is considerable varia-tion between individuals in metabolism of benzodi-azepines, so patient response may not be predictable. Asa class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics,but also as sedatives,muscle relaxants, and in treatmentof epilepsy and alcoholism. The distinctions betweenthese uses are largely determined by onset and durationof action, and route of administration.Buspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically relatedto other classes of central nervous system drugs, is also atraditional anxiolytic, although it is now consideredeither a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trialsof SSRIs and benzodiazepines. It is appropriate for use inpatients who have either failed trials of other treatments,or who should not receive benzodiazepines because of ahistory of substance abuse problems. Buspirone, in com-mon with antidepressants, requires a two to three weekperiod before there is clinical evidence of improvement,and must be continuously dosed to maintain its effects.

Recommended dosage
Benzodiazepines should be administered 30 to 60minutes before exposure to the anticipated stress. Dosage should be individualized to minimize sedation. The normal dose of alprazolam is 0.25–0.5 mg. Theusual dose of lorazepam is 2–3 mg. Doses may be repeat-ed if necessary.Buspirone is initially dosed at 5 mg t.i.d. (3 times aday.) Increase the dosage 5 mg/day, at intervals of two tothree days, as needed. Do not exceed 60 mg/day. Two tothree weeks may be required before a satisfactory responseis seen.
Precautions
Benzodiazepines should not be used in patients withpsychosis, acute narrow angle glaucoma, or liver dis-ease. The drugs can act as respiratory depressants andshould be avoided in patients with respiratory conditions.Benzodiazepines are potentially addictive and should notbe administered to patients with substance abuse disor-ders. Because benzodiazepines are sedative, they shouldbe avoided in patients who must remain alert. Their usefor periods over four months has not been documented.These drugs should not be used during the second andthird trimester of pregnancy, although use during thefirst trimester appears to be safe. They should not betaken while breastfeeding. Consult specialized referencesfor use in children.Buspirone is metabolized by the liver and excretedby the kidney, and should be used with care in patientswith hepatic or renal disease. The drug is classified asschedule B during pregnancy, but should not be takenduring breastfeeding. Its use in children under the age of18 years has not been studied.Side effects
The most common side effects of benzodiazepines aresecondary to their CNS effects and include sedation andsleepiness; depression; lethargy; apathy; fatigue; hypoac- tivity; lightheadedness; memory impairment; disorienta-tion; anterograde amnesia; restlessness; confusion; cryingor sobbing; delirium; headache; slurred speech; aphonia;dysarthria; stupor; seizures; coma; syncope; rigidity;tremor; dystonia; vertigo; dizziness; euphoria; nervous-ness; irritability; difficulty in concentration; agitation;inability to perform complex mental functions; akathisia;hemiparesis; hypotonia; unsteadiness; ataxia; incoordina-tion; weakness; vivid dreams; psychomotor retardation;“glassy-eyed” appearance; extrapyramidal symptoms;paradoxical reactions. Other reactions include changes inheart rate and blood pressure, changes in bowel function,severe skin rash and changes in genitourinary function.Other adverse effects have been reported.Buspirone has a low incidence of side effects. Dizzi-ness and drowsiness are the most commonly reportedadverse effects. Other CNS effects include dream distur-bances; depersonalization, dysphoria, noise intolerance,euphoria, akathisia, fearfulness, loss of interest, disasso-ciative reaction,hallucinations, suicidal ideation,seizures; feelings of claustrophobia, cold intolerance,stupor and slurred speech, psychosis.

Antiarrhythmic drugs
Definition
Antiarrhythmic drugs are medicines that correct irreg-ular heartbeats and slow down hearts that beat too fast.KEY TERMS
Anxiety—Worry or tension in response to real orimagined stress, danger, or dreaded situations.Physical reactions, such as fast pulse, sweating,trembling, fatigue, and weakness may accompanyanxiety.Epilepsy—A brain disorder with symptoms thatinclude seizures.Panic disorder—An disorder in which people havesudden and intense attacks of anxiety in certainsituations. Symptoms such as shortness of breath,sweating, dizziness, chest pain, and extreme fearoften accompany the attacks.Phobia—An intense, abnormal, or illogical fear ofsomething specific, such as heights or open spaces.Pregnancy category B—Animal studies indicateno fetal risk, but no human studies; or adverseeffects in animals, but not in well-controlledhuman studies.Pregnancy category C—No adequate human oranimal studies; or adverse fetal effects in animalstudies, but no available human data.Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.Purpose
Normally, the heart beats at a steady, even pace. Thepace is controlled by electrical signals that begin in one partof the heart and quickly spread through the whole heart. Ifsomething goes wrong with this control system, the resultmay be an irregular heartbeat, or an arrhythmia. Antiar-rhythmic drugs correct irregular heartbeats, restoring thenormal rhythm. If the heart is beating too fast, these drugswill slow it down. By correcting these problems, antiar-rhythmic drugs help the heart work more efficiently.
Description
Antiarrhythmic drugs are available only with aphysician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regularand extended release), tablet (regular and extended-release), and injectable forms. Commonly used antiar-rhythmic drugs are disopyramide (Norpace, NorpaceCR), procainamide (Procan SR, Pronestyl, Pronestyl-SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin, Duraquin, Quinidex,and other brands). Do not confuse quinidine with qui-nine, which is a related medicine with different uses, suchas relieving leg cramps.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofantiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be dif-ferent for different patients. Check with the physicianwho prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled theprescription for the correct dosage.Always take antiarrhythmic drugs exactly as direct-ed. Never take larger or more frequent doses.Do not stop taking this medicine without checkingwith the physician who prescribed it. Stopping it sudden-ly could lead to a serious change in heart function.Antiarrhythmic drugs work best when they are atconstant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the dayand night. Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine atnight interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult to remem-ber to take the medicine during the day, check with ahealth care professional for suggestions.
Precautions
Persons who take these drugs should see their physi-cian regularly. The physician will check to make sure themedicine is working as it should and will note anyunwanted side effects.Some people feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint whenusing these drugs. This medicine may cause blurred

Definition
Antiasthmatic drugs are medicines that treat or pre-vent asthmaattacks.
Purpose
For people with asthma, the simple act of breathingcan be a struggle. Their airways become inflamed andblocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing theopening through which air passes. This is not such a prob-lem when the person breathes in, because the airways nat-urally expand when a person takes a breath. The real prob-lem arises when the person with asthma tries to breatheout. The air cannot get out through the blocked airways, soit stays trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, theperson can take in only a little more air, so breathingbecomes shallow and takes more and more effort.Asthma attacks can be caused by allergiesto pollen, dust, pets or other things, but people without knownallergies may also have asthma. Exercise,stress, intense emotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines and somemedical conditions also can bring on attacks.The two main approaches to dealing with asthma areavoiding substances and situations that trigger attacksand using medicines that treat or prevent the symptoms.With a combination of the two, most people with asthmacan find relief and live normal lives.
Description
Three types of drugs are used in treating and pre-venting asthma attacks:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 236Antiasthmatic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 236•Bronchodilatorsrelax the smooth muscles that line theairway. This makes the airways open wider, lettingmore air pass through them. These drugs are used main-ly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to prevent attacksthat might come on after exercise. They may be takenby mouth, injected or inhaled.•Corticosteroidsblock the inflammation that narrowsthe airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help pre-vent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will beless severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop anattack that is already underway. These drugs may betaken by mouth, injected or inhaled.• Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthmaattacks and may be used alone or with other asthmamedicines. It cannot stop an attack that already hasstarted. The drug works by preventing certain cells inthe body from releasing substances that cause allergicreactions or asthma symptoms. One brand of thisdrug, Nasalcrom, comes in capsule and nasal sprayforms and is used to treat hay feverand other aller-gies. The inhalation form of the drug, Intal, is used forasthma. It comes in aerosol canisters, in capsules thatare inserted into an inhaler, and in liquid form that isused in a nebulizer.
Precautions
Using antiasthmatic drugs properly is important.Because bronchodilators provide quick relief, some peo-ple may be tempted to overuse them. However, withsome kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to seriousand possibly life-threatening complications. In the longrun, patients are better off using bronchodilators only asdirected and also using corticosteroids, which eventuallywill reduce their need for bronchodilators.Patients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs cor-rectly but feel their asthma is not under control shouldsee their physicians. The physician can either increasethe dose, switch to another medicine or add another med-icine to the regimen.Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that may causeserious side effects when used over a long time. However,these problems are much less likely with the inhalantforms than with the oral and injected forms. While theoral and injected forms generally should be used only forone to two weeks, the inhalant forms may be used forlong periods.When used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolynmust be taken as directed every day. The drug may takeas long as four weeks to start working. Unless told to doso by a physician, patients should not stop taking thedrug just because it does not seem to be working. Whensymptoms do begin to improve, patients should continuetaking all medicines that have been prescribed, unless aphysician directs otherwise.Side effects
Inhalant forms of antiasthmatic drugs may causedryness or irritation in the throat,dry mouth, or an unpleasant taste in the mouth. To help prevent theseproblems, gargle and rinse the mouth or take a sip ofwater after each dose.More serious side effects are not common whenthese medicines are used properly. However, anyone who

Antibiotic-associated colitis
Definition
Antibiotic-associated colitis is an inflammation ofthe intestines that sometimes occurs following antibiotictreatment and is caused by toxins produced by the bac-terium Clostridium difficile.
Description
Antibiotic-associated colitis, also called antibiotic-associated enterocolitis, can occur following antibiotictreatment. The bacteria Clostridia difficileare normallyfound in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but peo-ple can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hos-pital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless resi-dent intestinal bacteria compete with each other for foodand places to “sit” along the inner intestinal wall. Whenantibioticsare given, most of the resident bacteria areKEY TERMS

With fewer bacteria to compete with, the normallyharmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and producetoxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of theintestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea.Although all antibiotics can cause this disease, it ismost commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi-cillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, orWymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such ascefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition canoccur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeksafter the treatment has stopped.In approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associatedcolitis, the condition progresses to a more severe form ofcolitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in whichpseudomembranes are excreted in the stools. Pseudomem-branes are membrane-like collections of white blood cells,mucus, and the protein that causes blood to clot (fibrin)that are released by the damaged intestinal wall.
Causes and symptoms
Antibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins pro-duced by the bacterium Clostridium difficileafter treat-ment with antibiotics. When most of the other intestinalbacteria have been killed,Clostridium difficilegrows rapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinalwall. The disease and symptoms are caused by these tox-ins, not by the bacterium itself.Symptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usuallybegin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment hasbegun. The early signs and symptoms of this diseaseinclude lower abdominal cramps, an increased need topass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progress-es, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,fatigue, abdominal pain, and fever. If the disease pro-ceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patientmay also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts ofwatery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105°F/40-40.5°C). Complications of antibiotic-associated colitisinclude severe dehydration, imbalances in blood miner- als, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin(edema), enlargement of the large intestine (toxic mega-colon), and the formation of a tear (perforation) in thewall of the large intestine.Clostridium difficileis easily spread from person toperson in hospitals and nursing homes. The followingindividuals are most at-risk for developing this disease:• the elderly• severely ill individuals• individuals with weakened or suppressed immune sys-tems (immunocompromised)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 238Antibiotic-associated colitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 238• individuals with poor hygiene• individuals who have been hospitalized for a long peri-od of timeThe Clostridium difficiletoxin is found in the stoolsof persons older than 60 years of age 20-100 times morefrequently than in the stools of persons who are 10-20years old. As a result, the elderly are much more prone todeveloping antibiotic-associated colitis than youngerindividuals.
Diagnosis
Antibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by thesymptoms and recent medical history of the patient, by alaboratory test for the bacterial toxin, and/or by using aprocedure called endoscopy.If the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred afterthe patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated col-itis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzedfor the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. Thistoxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic-associated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxininvolves adding the processed stool sample to a humancell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, thecells die. It may take up to two days to get the resultsfrom this test. A simpler test, which provides results intwo to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxintest results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.Another tool that may be useful in the diagnosis ofantibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedurecalled an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin, lightedtube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lin-ing. Two different types of endoscopy procedures, thesigmoidoscopyand the colonoscopy, are used to viewdifferent parts of the large intestine. These proceduresare performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients aresedated during the procedure to make them more com-fortable and are allowed to go home after recoveringfrom the sedation.
Treatment
Diarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treatedby encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids andprevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-asso-ciated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic thatcaused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bac-teria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the over-growth of Clostridium difficile. Many patients with milddisease respond well to this and are free from diarrheawithin two weeks. It is important, however, to make surethat the original disease for which the antibiotics wereprescribed is treated.KEY TERMS
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon.Edema—Fluid accumulation in a tissue.Endoscopy—A procedure in which a thin, lightedinstrument is inserted into the interior of a holloworgan, such as the rectum and used to visuallyinspect the inner intestinal lining.Fibrin—A fibrous blood protein vital to coagula-tion and blood clot formation.Rectum—The last part of the intestine. Stool pass-es through the rectum and out through the analopening.Toxic megacolon—Acute enlargement or dilationof the large intestine.Because of the potential seriousness of this disease,most patients are given another antibiotic to control thegrowth of the Clostridium difficile, usually vancomycin(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Bothare designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14days. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of diarrheawithin one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go untreatedwith great success, however, severe relapses of diarrhearequire another round of antibiotic treatment. Instead offurther antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine resin(Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial tox-ins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and arepassed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,however, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so thesetwo drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious dis-ease may require hospitalization so that the patient canbe monitored, treated, and rehydrated.
Alternative treatment
The goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-asso-ciated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal envi-ronment with microorganisms that are normal andhealthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansismsthen compete for space and keep the Clostridium difficilefrom over-populating.Several types of supplements can be used. Supple-ments containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, the bacteriacommonly found in yogurt and some types of milk, Lacto- bacillus bifidus, and Streptococcus faecium, are availablein many stores in powder, capsule, tablet, and liquid form.Acidophilus also acts as a mild antibiotic, which helps it to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 239Antibiotic-associated colitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 239reestablish itself in the intestine, and all may aid in theproduction of some B vitaminsand vitamin K. These sup-plements can be taken individually and alternated weeklyor together following one or more courses of antibiotics.
Prognosis
With appropriate treatment and replenishment offluids, the prognosis is generally excellent. One or morerelapses can occur. Very severe colitis can cause a tear(perforation) in the wall of the large intestine that wouldrequire major surgery. Perforation of the intestine cancause a serious abdominal infection. Antibiotic-associat-ed colitis can be fatal in people who are elderly and/orhave a serious underlying illness, such as cancer.
Prevention
There are no specific preventative measures for thisdisease. Good general health can reduce the chance ofdeveloping a bacterial infection that would requireantibiotic treatment and the chance of picking up theClostridiabacteria. Maintaining good general health canalso reduce the seriousness and length of the condition,should it develop following antibiotic therapy.Resources

Antibiotics
Definition
Antibiotics may be informally defined as the sub-group of anti-infectives that are derived from bacterialsources and are used to treat bacterial infections. Otherclasses of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides, may be effective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics mayhave secondary uses, such as the use of demeclocycline(Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syn-drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)secretion. Other antibiotics may be useful in treating pro-tozoal infections.
Purpose
Antibiotics are used for treatment or prevention ofbacterial infection.
Description
ClassificationsAlthough there are several classification schemes forantibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad versus nar-row) or route of administration (injectable versus oral ver-sus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriosta-tic), the most useful is based on chemical structure. Antibi-otics within a structural class will generally show similarpatterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential.
PENICILLINS. The penicillinsare the oldest class ofantibiotics, and have a common chemical structure whichthey share with the cephalopsorins. The two groups areclassed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and are generallybacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria rather thaninhibiting growth. The penicillins can be further subdi-vided. The natural pencillins are based on the originalpenicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant penicillins,notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active even in thepresence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates mostnatural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillinand amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of actioncompared with the natural penicillins; extended spectrum
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 240AntibioticsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 240penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria.These generally include coverage for Pseudomonasaeruginaosaand may provide the penicillin in combina-tion with a penicillinase inhibitor.
CEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporinsand the closelyrelated cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pen-cillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure. Conse-quently, there are patterns of cross-resistance and cross-allergenicity among the drugs in these classes. The“cepha” drugs are among the most diverse classes ofantibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped into 1st, 2ndand 3rd generations. Each generation has a broader spec-trum of activity than the one before. In addition, cefox-itin, a cephamycin, is highly active against anaerobicbacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominalinfections. The 3rd generation drugs, cefotaxime, cefti-zoxime, ceftriaxone and others, cross the blood-brainbarrier and may be used to treat meningitisand encephalitis. Cephalopsorins are the usually preferredagents for surgical prophylaxis.
FLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn-thetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria.They are included here because they can be readily inter-changed with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, relatedclass of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were notwell absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinarytract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based onthe older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal drugsthat are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or thecephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone tis-sue, and so well absorbed that in general they are aseffective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.
TETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclinesgot their namebecause they share a chemical structure that has fourrings. They are derived from a species of Streptomycesbacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, thetetracyclines may be effective against a wide varietyof microorganisms, including rickettsia and amebicparasites.
MACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are derivedfrom Streptomycesbacteria, and got their name becausethey all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structure.Erythromycin, the prototype of this class, has a spectrumand use similar to penicillin. Newer members of thegroup, azithromycin and clarithyromycin, are particular-ly useful for their high level of lung penetration. Clar-ithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacterpyloriinfections, the cause of stomach ulcers.
OTHERS. Other classes of antibiotics include theaminoglycosides, which are particularly useful for theireffectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosainfec-tions; the lincosamindes, clindamycin and lincomycin,which are highly active against anaerobic pathogens.There are other, individual drugs which may have utilityin specific infections.Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, route of administration,pathogen, site of infection, and severity. Additional con-siderations include renal function, age of patient, andother factors. Consult manufacturers’ recommendationsfor dose and route.
Side effects
All antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by non-sus-ceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major hazardsby class; however, the health care provider should revieweach drug individually to assess the degree of risk. Gen-erally, breastfeeding is not recommended while takingantibiotics because of risk of alteration to infant’s intesti-nal flora, and risk of masking infection in the infant.Excessive or inappropriate use may promote growth ofresistant pathogens.Penicillins: Hypersensitivity may be common, andcross allergenicity with cephalosporins has been reported.Penicillins are classed as category B during pregnancy. Cephalopsorins: Several cephalopsorins and relatedcompounds have been associated with seizures. Cefmeta-zole, cefoperazone, cefotetan and ceftriaxone may be

Although doxycycline and minocycline may betaken with meals, patients must be advised to take othertetracycline antibiotics on an empty stomach, and not totake the drugs with milk or other calcium-rich foods.Expired tetracycline should never be administered. Preg-nancy category D. Use during pregnancy may causealterations in bone development.Macrolides: Erythromycin may aggravate the weak-ness of patients with myasthenia gravis. Azithromycinhas, rarely, been associated with allergic reactions,including angioedema,anaphylaxis, and dermatologicreactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome andtoxic epidermal necrolysis. Oral erythromycin may behighly irritating to the stomach and when given by injec-tion may cause severe phlebitis. These drugs should beused with caution in patients with liver dysfunction.Pregnancy category B: Azithromycin, erythromycin.Pregnancy category C: Clarithromycin, dirithromycin,troleandomycin.Aminoglycosides: This class of drugs causes kidneyand ototoxicity. These problems can occur even withnormal doses. Dosing should be based on renal function,with periodic testing of both kidney function and hear-ing. Pregnancy category D.
Recommended usage
To minimize risk of adverse reactions and develop-ment of resistant strains of bacteria, antibiotics should berestricted to use in cases where there is either known or areasonable presumption of bacterial infection. The use ofantibiotics in viral infections is to be avoided. Avoid useof fluroquinolones for trivial infections.In severe infections, presumptive therapy with abroad-spectrum antibiotic such as a 3rd generationcephalosporin may be appropriate. Treatment should bechanged to a narrow spectrum agent as soon as the

Category X: Evidenceof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.Purpose
Ophthalmic antibiotics are applied to the eye, orunder the eyelid, to treat eye infections caused by bacteria.
Description
The medicine described here, tobramycin (Tobrex),comes in the form of eye drops or ointment. It is avail-able only with a physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The dosages given here are typical doses. Physiciansmay adjust the number of doses per day, the timebetween doses, and the length of treatment with the med-icine, depending on the patient’s particular medical prob-lem. If the physician’s directions are different from thosegiven here, follow the physician’s directions.Be sure to follow package directions for applyingdrops or ointment properly.Adults
EYE DROPS. For mild to moderate infections, use oneto two drops in the affected eye or eyes every four hours.For severe infections, use two drops in the affectedeye or eyes every two hours until the condition improves.At that time, the physician will determine how much touse until the infection is completely cleared up.
OINTMENT. For mild to moderate infections,squeeze a half-inch ribbon of ointment into the affectedeye or eyes two or three times a day. Do not let the tip ofthe ointment tube touch the eye.For severe infections, squeeze a half-inch ribbon ofointment into the affected eye or eyes every three to fourhours until the condition improves. At that time, thephysician will determine how much to use until theinfection is completely cleared up.ChildrenThe child’s physician should determine the properdose.
Precautions
Use this drug as often as directed, for as long asdirected. Although the symptoms may have disap-peared, the infection may not clear up completely if thedrug is stopped too soon. Therefore, the medicationmay be prescribed for several days after the infectionappears to have cleared. However, it is just as importantto use the drug for onlyas long as directed. Using it for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 243Antibiotics, ophthalmicGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 243too long may lead to the growth of bacteria that do notrespond to the drug. These bacteria may then causeinfections that can be very difficult to treat. Make surethe physician or pharmacist specifies how long themedication is to be used.Anyone who has had an allergic reaction totobramycin or any other ingredients of Tobrex should notuse this medicine. Be sure to tell the physician about anypast reactions to the drug or its ingredients.Anyone who has an allergic reaction to tobramycinshould stop using it immediately and call a physician.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or whoplan to become pregnant should check with their physi-cians before using tobramycin.
Side effects
The main side effects of this medicine are itching, redness, and swelling of the eye or eyelid. Allergic reac-tions also are possible. If any of these symptoms occur,call the physician who prescribed the medicine.
Interactions
Patients who are using any other prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicines in their eyesshould check with their physicians before usingtobramycin.Nancy Ross-Flanigan
Antibiotics, topical
Definition
Topical antibioticsare medicines applied to the skinto kill bacteria.KEY TERMS
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that causemany diseases and infections.Ointment—A thick, spreadable substance thatcontains medicine and is meant to be used on theskin, or, if it is specifically an ophthalmic, or “eye”ointment, in the eyePurpose
Topical antibiotics help prevent infections caused bybacteria that get into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. Treating minor woundswith antibiotics allows quickerhealing. If the wounds are left untreated, the bacteria willmultiply, causing pain, redness, swelling,itching, and oozing. Untreated infections can eventually spread andbecome much more serious.Different kinds of topical antibiotics kill differentkinds of bacteria. Many antibiotic first-aid products con-tain combinations of antibiotics to make them effectiveagainst a broad range of bacteria.When treating a wound, it is not enough to simplyapply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be cleanedwith soap and water and patted dry. After the antibiotic isapplied, the wound should be covered with a dressing,such as a bandage or a protective gel or spray. For manyyears, it was thought that wounds heal best when exposedto the air. But now most experts say it is best to keepwounds clean and moist while they heal. The coveringshould still allow some air to reach the wound, however.
Description
Some topical antibiotics are available without a pre-scription and are sold in many forms, including creams,ointments, powders, and sprays. Some widely used topi-cal antibiotics are bacitracin, neomycin, mupirocin, andpolymyxin B. Among the products that contain one ormore of these ingredients are Bactroban (a prescriptionitem), Neosporin, Polysporin, and Triple Antibiotic Oint-ment or Cream.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type oftopical antibiotic. Follow the directions on the packagelabel or ask a pharmacist for directions.In general, topical antibiotics should be appliedwithin four hours after injury. Do not use more than therecommended amount and do not apply it more oftenthan three times a day. Do not apply the medicine overlarge areas of skin or on open wounds.
Precautions
Many public health experts are concerned aboutantibiotic resistance, a problem that can develop whenantibiotics are overused. Over time, bacteria develop newdefenses against antibiotics that once were effectiveagainst them. Because bacteria reproduce so quickly,these defenses can be rapidly passed on through genera-tions of bacteria until almost all are immune to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 244Antibiotics, topicalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 244effects of a particular antibiotic. The process happensfaster than new antibiotics can be developed. To helpcontrol the problem, many experts advise people to usetopical antibiotics only for short periods, that is, until thewound heals, and only as directed. For the topical antibi-otic to work best, it should be used only to prevent infec-tion in a fresh wound, not to treat an infection that hasalready started. Wounds that are not fresh may need theattention of a physician to prevent complications such asblood poisoning.Topical antibiotics are meant to be used only on theskin and only for only a few days at a time. If the woundhas not healed in five days, stop using the antibiotic andcall a doctor.Do not use topical antibiotics on large areas of skinor on open wounds. These products should not be used totreat diaper rashin infants or incontinence rash inadults.Only minor cuts, scrapes, and burns should be treat-ed with topical antibiotics. Certain kinds of injuries mayneed medical care and should not be self-treated withtopical antibiotics. These include:• large wounds• deep cuts• cuts that continue bleeding• cuts that may need stitches• burns any larger than a few inches in diameter• scrapes imbedded with particles that won’t wash away• animal bites• deep puncture wounds• eye injuriesNever use regular topical antibiotics in the eyes.Special antibiotic products are available for treating eyeinfections.Although topical antibiotics control infectionscaused by bacteria, they may allow fungal infections todevelop. The use of other medicines to treat the fungalinfections may be necessary. Check with the physician orpharmacist.Some people may be allergic to one or more ingredi-ents in a topical antibiotic product. If an allergic reactiondevelops, stop using the product immediately and call aphysician.No harmful or abnormal effects have been reportedin babies whose mothers used topical antibiotics whilepregnant or nursing. However, pregnant women generallyare advised not to use any drugs during the first 3 monthsafter conception. A woman who is pregnant or breastfeed-KEY TERMS

Anticancer drugs
Definition
Anticancer, or antineoplastic, drugs are used to treatmalignancies, cancerous growths. Drug therapy may beused alone, or in combination with other treatments suchas surgery or radiation therapy.
Purpose
Anticancer drugs are used to control the growth ofcancerous cells. Canceris commonly defined as theuncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiationand commonly, with metastasis, spread of the cancer toother tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths.In contrast, benign growths remain encapsulated and growwithin a well-defined area. Although benign tumors maybe fatal if untreated, due to pressure on essential organs, asin the case of a benign brain tumor, surgery or radiationare the preferred methods of treating growths which have awell defined location. Drug therapy is used when thetumor has spread, or may spread, to all areas of the body.
Description
Several classes of drugs may be used in cancer treat-ment, depending on the nature of the organ involved. Forexample, breast cancers are commonly stimulated byestrogens, and may be treated with drugs which inactivethe sex hormones. Similarly,prostate cancermay be treated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sexhormone. However, the majority of antineoplastic drugsKEY TERMS
Cataract—Clouding of the lens of the eye, leadingto poor vision or blindness.Impotent—Unable to achieve or maintain anerection of the penis.act by interfering with cell growth. Since cancerous cellsgrow more rapidly than other cells, the drugs target thosecells which are in the process of reproducing themselves.As a result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affectnot only the cancerous cells, but others cells that com-monly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles, ovariesand testis, and the blood-forming organs.Newer approaches to antineoplastic drug therapyhave taken different approaches, including angigenesis—the inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding thetumor and contributing to tumor growth. Although theseapproaches hold promise, they are not yet in common use.Antineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class-es: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle specificdrugs act only at specific points of the cell’s duplicationcycle, such as anaphase or metaphase, while non-cyclespecific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle. Inorder to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs arecommonly used in combinations.
Precautions
Because antineoplastic agents do not target specificcell types, they have a number of common adverse sideeffects. Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair fol-licles, and anemia, immune system impairment, and clot-ting problems are caused by destruction of the blood form-ing organs, leading to reduction in the number of red cells,white cells, and platelets. Because of the frequency andseverity of these side effects, it is common to administerchemotherapyin cycles, allowing time for recovery fromthe drug effects before administering the next dose. Dosesare often calculated, not on the basis of weight, but ratherbased on blood counts, in order to avoid dangerous levelsof anemia (red cell depletion),neutropenia(white celldeficiency), or thrombocytopenia(platelet deficiency.)Nausea and vomitingare among the most commonadverse effects of cancer chemotherapy, and in somecases may be severe enough to cause dose reduction ordiscontinuation of treatment.The health professional has many responsibilities indealing with patients undergoing chemotherapy. The
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 246Anticancer drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 246patient must be well informed of the risks and benefits ofchemotherapy, and must be emotionally prepared for theside effects. These may be permanent, and youngerpatients should be aware of the high risk of sterility afterchemotherapy.The patient must also know which side effectsshould be reported to the practitioner, since manyadverse effects do not appear until several days after adose of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is self-administered, the patient must be familiar with properuse of the drugs, including dose scheduling and avoid-ance of drug-drug and food-drug interactions.Appropriate steps should be taken to minimize sideeffects. These may include administration of antinause-ant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, main-taining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly tothe kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduceblood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due todrug therapy.Patients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk ofinfections due to reduced white blood counts. While pro-phylactic antibioticsmay be useful, the health care pro-fessional should also be sure to use standard precautions,including gowns and gloves when appropriate. Patientsshould be alerted to avoid risks of viral contamination,and live virus immunizations are contraindicated untilthe patient has fully recovered from the effects ofchemotherapy. Similarly, the patient should avoid contactwith other people who have recently had live virusimmunizations.Other precautions which should be emphasized arethe risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because antineo-plastic drugs are commonly harmful to the fetus, womenof childbearing potential should be cautioned to use twoeffective methods of birth control while receiving cancerchemotherapy. This also applies if the woman’s malepartner is receiving chemotherapy. Breastfeeding shouldbe avoided while the mother is being treated.Before prescribing or administering anticancerdrugs, health care providers should inquire whether thepatient has any of the following conditions:•chickenpoxor recent exposure to someone with chick-enpox• shingles (Herpes zoster)• mouth sores• current or past seizures

Anyone who hasunusual symptoms after taking anticancer drugs shouldcontact the physician who prescribed the medication.
Interactions
Anticancer drugs may interact with a number ofother medicines. When this happens, the effects of one orboth of the drugs may change or the risk of side effectsmay be greater. The health care provider should be awareof all other prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicines a patient is taking. The primary careprovider should also be told if the patient has been treat-ed with radiation or has taken other anticancer drugs.Samuel Uretsky, PharmD

Anticoagulant andantiplatelet drugs
Definition
Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent clot forma-tion or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlarging.They inhibit clot formation by blocking the action ofclotting factors or platelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall intothree categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis,inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.
Purpose
Anticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the bloodto form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to pre-vent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots insidethe blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organsand cause heart attacks and strokes. Although these drugsare sometimes called blood thinners, they do not actuallythin the blood. Furthermore, this type of medication willnot dissolve clots that already have formed, although thedrug stops an existing clot from worsening. However,another type of drug, used in thrombolytic therapy, will dissolve existing clots.Anticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi-tions. For example, they may be given to prevent bloodclots from forming after the replacement of a heart valveor to reduce the risk of a strokeor another heart attackafter a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce thechance of blood clots forming during open heart surgeryor bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may begiven to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay inbed for a long time after certain types of surgery.Because anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability toclot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding andheavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these drugsexactly as directed and to see a physician regularly aslong as they are prescribed.
Description
Anticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugsor blood thinners, are available only with a physician’sprescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms.They fall into three groups:• Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagu-lants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors inthe liver. One example is warfarin (brand name:coumadin).• Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interferewith blood clotting by blocking the activity of throm-bin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan).• Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact withplatelets, which is a type of blood cell, to blockplatelets from aggregating into harmful clots. Theyinclude:aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plav-ix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofanticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which itis prescribed. The prescribing physician or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription can provide information con-cerning the correct dosage. Usually, the physician willadjust the dose after checking the patient’s clotting time.Anticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct-ed by the physician. Larger or more frequent dosesshould not be taken, and the drug should also not betaken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of thismedication can cause severe bleeding.Anticoagulantsshould also be taken on schedule. A record of each doseshould be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it shouldbe taken as soon as possible followed by the regular doseschedule. However, a patient who forgets to take amissed dose until the next day should not take the misseddose at all and should not double the next dose, as thiscould lead to bleeding. A record of all missed dosesshould be kept for the prescribing physician who shouldbe informed at the scheduled visits.
Precautions
Persons who take anticoagulants should see a physi-cian regularly while taking these drugs, particularly atthe beginning of therapy. The physician will order peri-odic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. Theresults of these tests will help the physician determinethe proper amount of medication to be taken each day.Time is required for normal clotting ability to returnafter anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patientsmust observe the same precautions they observed whiletaking the drug. The length of time needed for the bloodto return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulantdrug that was taken. The prescribing physician will adviseas to how long the precautions should be observed.People who are taking anticoagulant drugs shouldtell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other med-ical professionals who provide medical treatments or ser-vices to them that they are taking such a medication.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 250Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 250They should also carry identification stating that they areusing an anticoagulant drug.Other prescription drugs or over-the-counter medi-cine—especially aspirin—should be not be taken withoutthe prescribing physician being informed.Because of the risk of heavy bleeding, anyone whotakes an anticoagulant drug must take care to avoidinjuries. Sports and other potentially hazardous activitiesshould be avoided. Any falls, blows to the body or head,or other injuries should be reported to a physician, asinternal bleeding may occur without any obvious symp-toms. Special care should be taken in shaving and inbrushing and flossing the teeth. Soft toothbrushes shouldbe used and the flossing should be very gentle. Electricrazors should be used instead of a blade.Alcohol can change the way anticoagulant drugsaffect the body. Anyone who takes this medicine shouldnot have more than one to two drinks at any time andshould not drink alcohol every day.Special conditionsPeople with specific medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake anticoagulant drugs. Before taking these drugs, theprescribing physician should be informed about any ofthese conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto anticoagulants in the past should let his or her physi-cian know before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergiesto beef, pork, orother foods; dyes; preservatives; or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Anticoagulants may cause many seri-ous problems if taken during pregnancy. Birth defects, severe bleeding in the fetus, and other problems thataffect the physical or mental development of the fetus ornewborn are possible. The mother may also experiencesevere bleeding if she takes anticoagulants during preg-nancy, during delivery, or even shortly after delivery.Women should not take start taking anticoagulants dur-ing pregnancy and should not become pregnant whiletaking it. Any woman who becomes pregnant or suspectsthat she has become pregnant while taking an anticoagu-lant should check with her physician immediately.
BREASTFEEDING. Some anticoagulant drugs maypass into breast milk. Blood tests can be done on nursingbabies to see whether the drug is causing any problems.If it is, other medication may be prescribed to counteractthe effects of the anticoagulant drug.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-coagulant drugs, people should inform their physicianabout anymedical problems they have. They should alsolet the physician who prescribed the medicine know ifthey are being treated by any other medical physician ordentist. In addition, people who will be taking anticoagu-lant drugs should let their physician know if they haverecently had any of the following:•feverlasting more than one to two days• severe or continuing diarrhea• childbirth• heavy or unusual menstrual bleeding• insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUD) • falls, injuries, or blows to the body or head• any type of surgery, including dental surgery• spinal anesthesia• radiation treatmentUSE OF CERTAIN FOODS AND MEDICINES. Many foods and drugs may affect the way the anticoagulantdrugs work or may increase the risk of side effects.
Side effects
The most common minor side effects are bloating orgas. These problems usually go away as the body adjuststo the drug and do not require medical treatment.More serious side effects may occur, especially ifexcessive anticoagulant is taken. If any of the followingside effects occur, a physician should be notified imme-diately:• bleeding gums• sores or white spots in the mouth or throat• unusual bruisesor purplish areas on the skin• unexplained nosebleeds• unusually heavy bleeding or oozing from wounds• unexpected or unusually menstrual bleeding• blood in the urine• cloudy or dark urine• painful or difficult urination or sudden decrease inamount of urine• black, tarry, or bloody stools• coughing up blood• vomiting blood or something that looks like coffeegrounds• constipation•painor swelling in the stomach or abdomen• back pain• stiff, swollen, or painful joints

Anyone who hasunusual symptoms while taking anticoagulant drugsshould get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Anticoagulants may interact with many other med-ications. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe increased. Anyone who takes anticoagulants shouldinform the prescribing physician about other prescrip-tion or nonprescription (over-the-counter medicines) heKEY TERMS
Anticoagulant—Drug used to prevent clot forma-tion or to prevent a clot that has formed fromenlarging. Anticoagulant drugs inhibit clot forma-tion by blocking the action of clotting factors orplatelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall into three groups:inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis, inhibitors ofthrombin and antiplatelet drugs.Antiplatelet drug—Drug that inhibits platelets fromaggregating to form a plug. They are used to preventclotting and alter the natural course of atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis—Condition characterized by depositsof fatty plaque in the arteries.Clot—A soft, semi-solid mass that forms whenblood gels.Platelet—A small, disk-shaped body in the bloodthat has an important role in blood clotting: theyform the initial plug at the rupture site of a bloodvessel.Thrombin—Thrombin is a protein produced by thebody. It is a specific clotting factor that plays animportant role in the blood clotting process.Thrombin inhibitor—Thrombin inhibitors are onetype of anticoagulant medication, used to help pre-vent formation of harmful blood clots in the bodyby blocking the activity of thrombin.or she is taking—even aspirin, laxatives, vitamins, andantacids.Diet also affects the way anticoagulant drugs workin the body. A normal, balanced diet should be followedevery day while taking such medication. No dietarychanges should be made without informing first the pre-scribing physician, who should also be told of any illnessor other condition interfering with the ability to eat nor-mally. Diet is a very important consideration because theamount of vitamin K in the body affects how anticoagu-lant drugs work. Dicoumarol and warfarin act by reduc-ing the effects of vitamin K. Vitamin K is found in meats,dairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multi-ple vitaminsand nutritional supplements. For the drugsto work properly, it is best to have the same amount ofvitamin K in the body all the time. Foods containing vita-min K in the diet should not be increased or decreasedwithout consulting with the prescribing physician. If thepatient takes vitamin supplements, he should check thelabel to see if it contains vitamin K. Because vitamin K isalso produced by intestinal bacteria, a severe case ofdiarrhea or the use of laxativesmay also alter a person’svitamin K levels.Nancy Ross-Flanigan
Anticonvulsant drugs
Definition
Anticonvulsant drugs are medicines used to preventor treat convulsions (seizures).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 252Anticonvulsant drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 252Purpose
Anticonvulsant drugs are used to control seizures inpeople with epilepsy. Epilepsy is not a single disease—itis a set of symptoms that may have different causes indifferent people. The common thread is an imbalance inthe brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causesseizures that may affect part or all of the body and mayor may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsantdrugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severi-ty of seizures.Some cases of epilepsy are brought on by headinjuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic prob-lems such as low blood sugar. But in some people withepilepsy, the cause is not clear.Anticonvulsant drugs are an important part of thetreatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of drugsmay be prescribed for different types of seizures. In addi-tion to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy should getenough rest, avoid stress, and practice good health habits.Some physicians believe that giving the drugs tochildren with epilepsy may prevent the condition fromgetting worse in later life. However, others say the effectsare the same, whether treatment is started early or later inlife. Determining when treatment begins depends on thephysician and his assessment of the patient’s symptoms.Physicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsantdrugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorderand migraine headaches.
Description
Anticonvulsant drugs may be divided into severalclasses. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) andmephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include etho-suximide (Zarontin)and methsuccimide (Celontin.) Thebenzodiazepines, which are better known for their use astranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam(Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam (Vali-um.) There are also a large number of other drugs whichare not related to larger groups. These include carba-mazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote, Depak-ene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), fel-bamate (Felbatol) and several others. Phenobarbital hasbeen used as an anticonvulsant, and is still useful forsome patients. The drugs are available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liquid,and “sprinkle” forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofanticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures forwhich it is being taken. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering thedose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects.Do not change brands or dosage forms of this medi-cine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If aprescription refill does not look like the original medicine,check with the pharmacist who filled the prescription.Precautions
Patients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a physi-cian regularly while on therapy, especially during thefirst few months. The physician will check to make surethe medicine is working as it should and will noteunwanted side effects. The physician may also need toadjust the dosage during this period.Valproic acid can cause serious liver damage, espe-cially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children are par-ticularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine shouldsee their physician regularly for tests of liver function andshould be alert to symptoms of liver damage, such as yel-low skin and eyes, facial swelling, loss of appetite, gener-al feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liverproblems are suspected, call a physician immediately.Felbatol has caused serious liver damage and aplas- tic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow stopsproducing blood cells. Patients taking this drug shouldhave regular blood counts, and should stop taking thedrug if there are too few red blood cells.While taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start orstop taking any other medicines without checking with aphysician. The other medicines may affect the way theanticonvulsant medicine works.Because anticonvulsant drugs work on the centralnervous system, they may add to the effects of alcoholand other drugs that slow down the central nervous sys-tem, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergymedicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tran-quilizers, some painrelievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check withhis or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking anymedicines that slow the central nervous system.Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicinesused during surgery, dental procedures, or emergencytreatment. These interactions could increase the chanceof side effects. Anyone who is taking anticonvulsantdrugs should be sure to tell the health care professional incharge before having any surgical or dental procedures orreceiving emergency treatment.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 253Anticonvulsant drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 253Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or lessalert when using these drugs, especially when they firstbegin taking them or when their dosage is increased.Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs should not drive,use machines or do anything else that might be danger-ous until they have found out how the drugs affect them.Anticonvulsant drugs may affect the results of certainmedical tests. Before having medical tests, people whotake anticonvulsant drugs should make sure that the med-ical professional in charge knows what they are taking.Children may be more likely to have certain sideeffects from anticonvulsant drugs, such as behaviorchanges; tender, bleeding, or swollen gums; enlargedfacial features; and excessive hair growth. Problems withthe gums may be prevented by regularly brushing andflossing, massaging the gums, and having the teethcleaned every 3 months whether the patient is a child oran adult.Children who take high doses of this medicine for along time may have problems in school.Older people may be more sensitive to the effects ofanticonvulsant drugs. This may increase the chance ofside effects and overdoses.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake anticonvulsant drugs. Before taking these drugs, besure to let the physician know about any of these condi-tions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto anticonvulsant drugs or to tricyclic antidepressantssuch as imipramine (Tofranil) or desipramine (Nor-pramin) in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Birth defectshave been reported inbabies born to mothers who took anticonvulsant drugsduring pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or whomay become pregnant should check with their physiciansabout the safety of using anticonvulsant drugs duringpregnancy.Some anticonvulsant drugs taken during pregnancymay cause bleeding problems in the mother during deliv-ery and in the baby after delivery. This problem can beavoided by giving vitamin K to the mother during deliv-ery and to the baby after birth.Pregnancy may affect the way the body absorbs anti-convulsant drugs. Women who are prone to seizures mayhave more seizures during pregnancy, even though theyare taking their medicine regularly. If this happens, theyshould check with their physicians about whether thedose needs to be increased.BREASTFEEDING. Some anticonvulsant drugs passinto breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in babieswhose mothers take the medicine. Women who arebreastfeeding should check with their physicians aboutthe benefits and risks of using anticonvulsant drugs.
DIABETES. Anticonvulsant drugs may affect bloodsugar levels. Patients with diabetes who notice changesin the results of their urine or blood tests should checkwith their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-convulsant drugs, people with any of these medical prob-lems should make sure their physicians are aware of theirconditions:• liver disease• kidney disease• thyroid disease• heart or blood vessel disease• blood disease• brain disease• problems with urination• current or past alcohol abuse• behavior problems• diabetes mellitus•glaucoma• porphyria• systemic lupus erythematosus•feverhigher than 101°F (38.3°C) for more than 24hours
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking anticonvulsantdrugs with certain other drugs may affect the way thedrugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are constipation, mild nausea or vomiting, and mild dizziness, drowsiness,or lightheadedness. These problems usually go away asthe body adjusts to the drug and do not require medicaltreatment. Less common side effects, such as diarrhea, sleep problems, aching joints or muscles, increased sen-sitivity to sunlight, increased sweating, hair loss, enlarge-ment of facial features, excessive hair growth, muscletwitching, and breast enlargement in males also may

Anyone who hasunusual symptoms after taking anticonvulsant drugsshould get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Some anticonvulsant drugs should not be takenwithin two to three hours of taking antacidsor medicinefor diarrhea. These medicines may make the anticonvul-sant drugs less effective. Ask the pharmacist or physicianfor more information.Birth control pills may not work properly when anti-convulsant drugs are being taken. To prevent pregnancy,ask the physician or pharmacist if additional methods ofbirth control should be used while taking anticonvulsantdrugs.Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with many othermedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater. Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugsshould let the physician know all other medicines he orshe is taking. Among the drugs that may interact withcertain anticonvulsant drugs are:• airway opening drugs (bronchodilators) such asaminophylline, theophylline (Theo-Dur and otherbrands), and oxtriphylline (Choledyl and other brands)• medicines that contain calcium, such as antacids andcalcium supplementsKEY TERMS

Antidepressant drugs
Definition
Antidepressant drugs are medicines that relievesymptoms of depressive disorders.
Purpose
Depressive disorders may be either unipolar (depres-sion alone) or bipolar (depression alternating with peri-ods of extreme excitation). The formal diagnosis requiresa cluster of symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. Thesesymptoms include, but are not limited to mood changes,insomniaor hypersomnia, and diminished interest indaily activities. The symptoms are not caused by anymedical condition, drug side effect, or adverse life event.The condition is severe enough to cause clinically signif-icant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning.Secondary depression, depression caused by unfa-vorable life events, is normally self limiting, and may bebest treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy rather thandrugs.
Description
Antidepressant agents act by increasing the levels ofexcitatory neurostransmitters. The main types of antide-pressant drugs in use today are:• tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)•selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs orserotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), parox-etine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)•monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors),such as phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Par-nate)• tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressantswhich do not fall into any of the above categoriesSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev-els of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in thebrain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. Thesehave become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychi-atric disorders, primarily because of their low incidenceof severe side effects as compared with other drugs inthis therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions andside effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action.Tricyclic compounds, identified by their chemicalstructure containing three carbon rings, are an older classof antidepressants. Although generally effective, theyhave a high incidence of anticholinergic effects, notablydry mouthand dry eyes, which can cause discomfort.They also cause cardiac arrythmias. Because tricyclicsact on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may havesome value in treatment of patients who fail to respond toSSRIs. Drugs in this class are often available at lowprices, which may be significant when cost is a majorfactor in treatment. They have also been found useful incontrol of some neurologic painsyndromes.Tricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary inseverity of side effects, most notably the degree of seda- tionand the extent of the anticholinergic effects.Tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressantsare chemically distinct from both the major groups andeach other. Although maprotilene (no brand name, mar-keted in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron)are similar in chemical structures, they differ in their bal-ance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine [Nardil],tranylcypromine [Parnate]) have largely been supplanted
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 256Antidepressant drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 256in therapy because of their high risk of severe adverseeffects, most notably severe hypertension. They act byinhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which isresponsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neuro-hormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, andserotonin. The MAOIs are normally reserved for patientswho are resistant to safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl(Carbex, used in treatment of Parkinson’s disease) and the herb,St. John’s wort, have some action againstmonoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value asanti-depressants. They do not share the same risks as thenon-selective MAO inhibitors.All antidepressant agents, regardless of their struc-ture, have a slow onset of action, typically three to fiveweeks. Although adverse effects may be seen as early asthe first dose, significant therapeutic improvement isalways delayed. Similarly, the effects of antidepressantswill continue for a similar length of time after the drugshave been discontinued.
Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the specific drug and patient. Con-sult specialized references.
Precautions
Antidepressants have many significant cautions andadverse effects. Although a few are listed here, specificreferences should be consulted for more complete infor-mation.SSRIs. The most common side effect of SSRIs is exci-tation and insomnia. Excitation has been reported in over20% of patients, and insomnia in 33%. Significant weightloss has been frequently reported, but most commonly inpatients who are already underweight. SSRIs may causesome sedation, and patients should be cautioned not to per-form tasks requiring alertness until they have evaluated theeffects of these drugs. SSRIs are pregnancycategory Cdrugs. Most SSRIs are excreted in breast milk, and therehave been anecdotal reports of somnolence in infantswhose mothers were taking SSRIs while breastfeeding.Tricyclic antidepressants. Amoxepine (not marketedby brand, generic available), although a tricyclic antide-pressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer),displays some of the more serious effects of the neu-roleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug inducedinvoluntary movements) and neuroleptic malignant syn-drome, a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptomsinclude high fever, altered mental status, irregular pulseor blood pressure, and changes in heart rate. Theseadverse effects have not been reported with other tri-cyclic antidepressants.The most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide-pressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effects,such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult urination. Alter-ations in heartbeat are also common, and may progress tocongestive heart failure,stroke, and sudden death.Tricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categoriesC or D, although there have been no formal studies of thedrugs on fetal development. There are no studies ofeffects on newborns, but some anecdotal reports of mal-formations have resulted from animal studies. The drugsare excreted in breast milk.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The greatest riskassociated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis whichmay be fatal and most often occurs when the drugs aretaken with interacting foods or drugs. More commonadverse reactions may include low blood pressure andslowing of heartbeat. Sedation and gastrointestinal distur-bances are also common. MAOIs are in pregnancy cate-gory C. Safety in breast feeding has not been established.

Interactions
The antidepressants have many drug interactions,some severe. Although a few are listed here, specific refer-ences should be consulted for more complete information.SSRIs should not be administered with MAOIs.Allow a wash-out period of about four weeks beforeswitching from one class of drugs to the other. Allow fiveweeks if switching from fluoxetine (Prozac) to an MAOI.MAOIs have many interactions; however the bestknown are those with foods containing the amino acid tyra-mine. These include aged cheese, chianti wine, and manyothers. Patients and providers should review the MAOI dietrestrictions before using or prescribing these drugs.Because of the severity of MAOI interactions, all additionsto the patient’s drug regimen should be reviewed with care.Tricyclic compounds have many interactions, andspecialized references should be consulted. Specificallyavoid other drugs with anticholinergic effects. Tricyclicsshould not be taken with the antibioticsgrepafloxacinand sprafloxacin, since the combination may cause seri-ous heart arrythmias.KEY TERMS

Antidepressants, tricyclic
Definition
Tricyclic antidepressants are medicines that relievemental depression.
Purpose
Since their discovery in the 1950s, tricyclic antide-pressants have been used to treat mental depression. Likeother antidepressant drugs, they reduce symptoms suchas extreme sadness, hopelessness, and lack of energy.Some tricyclic antidepressants are also used to treatbulimia,cocainewithdrawal,panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, certain types of chronic pain, and bed-wettingin children.
Description
Named for their three-ring chemical structure, tri-cyclic antidepressants work by correcting chemicalimbalances in the brain. But because they also affectother chemicals throughout the body, these drugs mayproduce many unwanted side effects.Tricyclic antidepressants are available only with aphysician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,liquid, and injectable forms. Some commonly used tri-cyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline (Elavil),desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), nor-triptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil). Differ-ent drugs in this family have different effects, and physi-cians can choose the drug that best fits the patient’s symp-toms. For example, a physician might prescribe Elavil for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 258Antidepressants, tricyclicGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 258a person with depression who has trouble sleeping,because this drug is more likely to make people feel calmand sleepy. Other tricyclic antidepressants might be moreappropriate for depressed people with low energy.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on many factors,including the patient’s age, weight, general health andsymptoms. The type of tricyclic antidepressant and itsstrength also must be considered. Check with the physi-cian who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage.Always take tricyclic antidepressants exactly asdirected. Never take larger or more frequent doses, anddo not take the drug for longer than directed. Do not stoptaking the medicine just because it does not seem to beworking. Several weeks may be needed for its effects tobe felt. Visit the physician as often as recommended sothat the physician can check to see if the drug is workingand to note for side effects.Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering thedose may be necessary to reduce the chance of withdraw-al symptoms.Taking this medicine with food may prevent upsetstomach.
Precautions
The effects of this medicine may continue for threeto seven days after patients stop taking it. All precautionsshould be observed during this period, as well asthroughout treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, whentaking these drugs. The drugs may also cause blurredvision. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive,use machines or do anything else that might be dangerousuntil they have found out how the drugs affect them.Because tricyclic antidepressants work on the centralnervous system, they may add to the effects of alcoholand other drugs that cause drowsiness, such as antihista-mines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medi-cine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, andmuscle relaxants. Anyone taking tricyclic antidepres-sants should check with his or her physician before drink-ing alcohol or taking any drugs that cause drowsiness.These medicines make some people feel lighthead-ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lyingdown. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and holdonto something for support if possible.Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with medi-cines used during surgery, dental procedures, or emer-gency treatment. These interactions could increase thechance of side effects. Anyone who is taking tricyclicantidepressants should be sure to tell the health care pro-fessional in charge before having any surgical or dentalprocedures or receiving emergency treatment.These drugs may also change the results of medicaltests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking thismedicine should alert the health care professional incharge.This medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.Even brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn or a rash. While being treated with this tricyclic antide-pressants, avoid being in direct sunlight, especiallybetween 10 A.M. and 3 P.M.; wear a hat and tightly wovenclothing that covers the arms and legs; use a sunscreenwith a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15; protectthe lips with a sun block lipstick; and do not use tanningbeds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.Tricyclic antidepressants may cause dry mouth. To temporarily relieve the discomfort, chew sugarless gum,suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva substi-tutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and areavailable without a prescription.Children and older people are especially sensitive tothe effects of tricyclic antidepressants. This increasedsensitivity may increase the chance of side effects.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake tricyclic antidepressants. Before taking these drugs,be sure to let the physician know about any of these con-ditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto tricyclic antidepressants or to carbamazepine (Tegre-tol), maprotiline (Ludiomil), or trazodone (Desyrel) inthe past should let his or her physician know before tak-ing tricyclic antidepressants. The physician should alsobe told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Problems have been reported in babieswhose mothers took tricyclic antidepressants just beforedelivery. Women who are pregnant or who may becomepregnant should check with their physicians about thesafety of using tricyclic antidepressants.
BREASTFEEDING. Tricyclic antidepressants pass intobreast milk and may cause drowsiness in nursing babieswhose mothers take the drugs. Women who are breast-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 259Antidepressants, tricyclicGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 259feeding should check with their physicians before usingtricyclic antidepressants.
DIABETES. Tricyclic antidepressants may affectblood sugar levels. Diabetic patients who notice changesin blood or urine test results while taking this medicineshould check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using tri-cyclic antidepressants, people with any of these medicalproblems should make sure their physicians are aware oftheir conditions:• current or past alcohol or drug abuse• bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness)• schizophrenia• seizures (convulsions)• heart disease• high blood pressure• kidney disease• liver disease• overactive thyroid• stomach or intestinal problems• enlarged prostate• problems urinating•glaucoma•asthma
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking tricyclic anti-depressants with certain other drugs may affect the waythe drugs work or may increase the chance of sideeffects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, unpleasant taste,headache, nau- sea, mild tiredness or weakness, increased appetite orcraving for sweets, and weight gain. These problemsusually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and donot require medical treatment. Less common side effects,such as diarrhea, vomiting, sleep problems, sweating,and heartburnalso may occur and do not need medicalattention unless they do not go away or they interferewith normal activities.More serious side effects are not common, but mayoccur. If any of the following side effects occur, checkwith the physician who prescribed the medicine as soonas possible:• blurred vision• eye pain• confusion•hallucinations• fainting• loss of balance• swallowing problems• difficulty speaking• mask-like face• shakiness or trembling• nervousness or restlessness• movement problems, such as shuffling walk, stiff armsand legs, or slow movement• decreased sexual ability• fast or irregular heartbeat• constipation• problems urinatingSome side effects may continue after treatment withtricyclic antidepressants has ended. Check with a physi-cian if these symptoms occur:• headache• nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea• sleep problems, including vivid dreams• unusual excitement, restlessness, or irritabilityInteractions
Life-threatening reactions, such as extrememly highblood pressure, may occur when tricyclic antidepressantsare taken with other antidepressants called monoamineoxidase (MAO) inhibitors (such as Nardil and Parnate).Do not take tricyclic antidepressants within 2 weeks oftaking a MAO inhibitor. However, a patient can take anMAO inhibitor immediately after tricyclic antidepressanttherapy is stopped by the physician. Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with manyother medicines. When this happens, the effects of one orboth of the drugs may change or the risk of side effectsmay be greater. Anyone who takes tricyclic antidepres-sants should let the physician know all other medicineshe or she is taking. Among the drugs that may interactwith tricyclic antidepressants are:• Central nervous system (CNS) depressants such asmedicine for allergies, colds, hay fever, and asthma;sedatives; tranquilizers; prescription pain medicine;muscle relaxants; medicine for seizures; sleep aids;barbiturates; and anesthetics.• Diet pills

Antidiabetic drugs
Definition
Antidiabetic drugs are medicines that help controlblood sugar levels in people with diabetes mellitus(sugar diabetes).
Purpose
Diabetes may be divided into type I and type II, for-merly termed juvenile onset or insulin-dependent, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 261Antidiabetic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 261maturity onset or non insulin-dependent. Type I is causedby a deficiency of insulin production, while type II ischaracterized by insulin resistance.Treatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulinreplacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a num-ber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulinresistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases ininsulin secretion, and others may be controlled by dietand exercise. Drug therapy may be directed towardsincreasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivi-ty, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.
Description
Antidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups:insulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.Insulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsi-ble for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types ofdiabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivi-ty remains and the condition can be treated with largerdoses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced byrecombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically identi-cal to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin suspen-sion, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations areintended to extend the duration of action of insulin, andpermit glucose control over longer periods of time.Sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolaza-mide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act byincreasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pan-crease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this class,appears to have a useful secondary action in increasinginsulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],miglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.Rather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides andcomplex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism doesnot prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing thepeak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitorsare useful for either monotherapy or in combination ther-apy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents.Metformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem-ber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepaticglucose production, decreases intestinal absorption ofglucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and uti-lization. Metformin may be used as monotherapy, or incombination therapy with a sulfonylurea.There are two members of the meglitinide class:repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). Themechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulateinsulin production. This activity is both dose dependentand dependent on the presence of glucose, so that thedrugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of lowblood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,or in combination with metformin. The manufacturerwarns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina-tion with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion.Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)and the members of the thiazolidinedione class. They actby both reducing glucose production in the liver, andincreasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in musclecells. They do not increase insulin production. Thesedrugs may be used in combination with metoformin or asulfonylurea.Recommended dosage
Dosage must be highly individualized for all antidia-betic agents and is based on blood glucose levels whichmust be taken regularly. Review specific literature.
Precautions
Insulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin ishypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a directoverdose or an imbalance between insulin injection andlevel of exercise and diet. This may also occur in thepresence of other conditions which reduce the glucoseload, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Treat- ment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liq-uid, although severe cases may require intravenous thera-py. Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occur.Insulin is classified as category B in pregnancy, and is considered the drug of choice for glucose control duringpregnancy. Insulin glargine (Lantus), an insulin analogwhich is suitable for once-daily dosing, is classified ascategory C, because there have been reported changes inthe hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. Thereports are essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effectrelationship has been determined. Insulin is not recom-mended during breast feeding because either low of highdoses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulinadministered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and rep-resents no risk to the newborn.Sulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may causehypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to thesedrugs over time, and may require either dose adjustmentsor a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions isextensive, and includes central nervous system problemsand skin reactions, among others. Hematologic reactions,although rare, may be severe and include aplastic ane-miaand hemolytic anemia. The administration of oralhypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increasedcardiovascular mortality as compared with treatmentwith diet alone or diet plus insulin. The sulfonylureas areclassified as category C during pregnancy, based on ani-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 262Antidiabetic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 262mal studies, although glyburide has not shown any harmto the fetus and is classified as category B. Because theremay be significant alterations in blood glucose levelsduring pregnancy, it is recommended that patients beswitch to insulin. These drugs have not been fully studiedduring breast feeding, but it is recommended thatbecause their presence in breast milk might cause hypo-glycemia in the newborn, breastfeeding be avoided whiletaking sulfonylureas.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are generally well tol-erated, and do not cause hypoglycemia. The most com-mon adverse effects are gastrointestinal problems,including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These drugs are classified as category B in pregnancy.Although there is no evidence that the drugs are harmfulto the fetus, it is important that rigid blood glucose con-trol be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnantwomen should be switched to insulin. Alpha-glucosidaseinhibitors may be excreted in small amounts in breastmilk, and it is recommended that the drugs not be admin-istered to nursing mothers.Metformin causes gastrointestinal reactions in abouta third of patients. A rare, but very serious, reaction tometformin is lactic acidosis, which is fatal in about 50%of cases. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiplemedical problems, including renal insufficiency. The riskmay be reduced with careful renal monitoring, and care-ful dose adjustments to metformin. Metformin is catego-ry B during pregnancy. There have been no carefullycontrolled studies of the drug during pregnancy, but thereis no evidence of fetal harm from animal studies. It isimportant that rigid blood glucose control be maintainedduring pregnancy, and pregnant women should beswitched to insulin. Animal studies show that metforminis excreted in milk. It is recommended that metforminnot be administered to nursing mothers.Meglitinides. These drugs are generally well tolerat-ed, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. Thedrugs are classified as category C during pregnancy,based on fetal abnormalities in rabbits given about 40times the normal human dose. It is important that rigidblood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy,and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It isnot known whether the meglitinides are excreted inhuman milk, but it is recommended that these drugs notbe given to nursing mothers.Thiazolidinediones. These drugs are generally welltolerated, however they are structurally related to an ear-lier drug, troglitazone, which was associated with liverfunction problems. It is strongly recommended that allpatients treated with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone haveregular liver function monitoring. The drugs are classi-fied as pregnancy category C, based on evidence of inhi-bition of fetal growth in rats given more than four timesthe normal human dose. It is important that rigid bloodglucose control be maintained during pregnancy, andpregnant women should be switched to insulin. It is notknown whether the thiazolidinediones are excreted inhuman milk, however they have been identified in themilk of lactating rats. It is recommended that these drugsnot be administered to nursing mothers.
Interactions
The sulfonylureas have a particularly long list ofdrug interactions, several of which may be severe.Review specific literature for these drugs.The actions of oral hypoglycemic agents may bestrengthened by highly protein bound drugs, includingNSAIDs, salicylates,sulfonamides, chloramphenicol,coumarins, probenecid, MAOIs, and beta blockers.Review the specific literature of each drugs for pos-sible drug-drug or food-drug interactions.Resources

Antidiarrheal drugs
Definition
Antidiarrheal drugs are medicines that relieve diarrhea.KEY TERMS
Blood sugar—The concentration of glucose in theblood.Glucose—A simple sugar that serves as the body’smain source of energy.Hormone—A substance that is produced in onepart of the body, then travels through the blood-stream to another part of the body where it has itseffect.Metabolism—All the physical and chemicalchanges that occur in cells to allow growth andmaintain body functions. These include processesthat break down substances to yield energy andprocesses that build up other substances necessaryfor life.Pregnancy category—A system of classifyingdrugs according to their established risks for useduring pregnancy. Category A: Controlled humanstudies have demonstrated no fetal risk. CategoryB: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but nohuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, butnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:No adequate human or animal studies; or adversefetal effects in animal studies, but no availablehuman data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidenceof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.Salicylates—A group of drugs that includes aspirinand related compounds. Salicylates are used torelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.Purpose
Antidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and someof the symptoms that go along with it. An average,healthy person has anywhere from three bowel move-ments a day to three a week, depending on that person’sdiet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in abowel movement) has a texture something like clay. Withdiarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent, andthe texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery.Diarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some otherproblem. The symptom may be caused by eating or drink-ing food or water that is contaminated with bacteria, virus-es, or parasites, or by eating something that is difficult todigest. People who have trouble digesting lactose (milksugar), for example, may get diarrhea if they eat dairyproducts. Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress, while others are brought on by taking certain medicines.
Description
Antidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The drugloperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example, slowsthe passage of stools through the intestines. This allowsmore time for water and salts in the stools to beabsorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta-pulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing sub-stances from the digestive tract. However, they may alsopull out substances that the body needs, such asenzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate, the ingre-dient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion of fluidinto the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria. Itnot only controls diarrhea, but relieves the cramps thatoften accompany diarrhea.These medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, andchewable tablet forms and can be bought without aphysician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug.Read and follow the directions on the product label. Forquestions about dosage, check with a physician or phar-macist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and donot take the drug for longer than directed.
Precautions
Diarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If theproblem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back, diarrheacould be a sign of a more serious problem. Anyone whohas any of the symptoms listed below should get medicalattention as soon as possible:• diarrhea that lasts more than two days or gets worse
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 264Antidiarrheal drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 264•f e v e r• blood in the stool• vomiting• cramps or tenderness in the abdomen• Signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination,dizzinessor lightheadedness,dry mouth, increasedthirst, or wrinkled skinDo not use antidiarrheal drugs for more than twodays unless told to do so by a physician.Severe, long-lasting diarrhea can lead to dehydra-tion. In such cases, lost fluids and salts, such as calcium,sodium, and potassium, must be replaced.People older than 60 should not use attapulgite(Kaopectate, Donnagel, Parepectolin), but may use otherkinds of antidiarrheal drugs. However, people in this agegroup may be more likely to have side effects, such assevere constipation, from bismuth subsalicylate. Ask thepharmacist for more information.Bismuth subsalicylate may cause the tongue or thestool to temporarily darken. This is harmless. However,do not confuse this harmless darkening of the stool withthe black, tarry stools that are a sign of bleeding in theintestinal tract.Children with flu or chicken pox should not be givenbismuth subsalicylate. It can lead to Reye’s syndrome,a life-threatening condition that affects the liver and centralnervous system. To be safe, never give bismuth subsalicy-late to a child under 16 years without consulting a physi-cian. Children may have unpredictable reactions to otherantidiarrheal drugs. Loperamide should not be given to chil-dren under six years and attapulgite should not be given tochildren under three years unless directed by a physician.Anyone who has a history of liver disease or whohas been taking antibioticsshould check with his or herphysician before taking the antidiarrheal drug lop-eramide. A physician should also be consulted beforeanyone with acute ulcerative colitisor anyone who hasbeen advised to avoid constipation uses the drug.Loperamide should not be used by people whosediarrhea is caused by certain infections, such as salmo-nella or shigella. To be safe, check with a physicianbefore using this drug.Anyone who has a medical condition that causesweakness should check with a physician about the bestway to treat diarrhea.Special conditionsBefore taking antidiarrheal drugs, be sure to let thephysician know about any of these conditions:ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto aspirinor other drugs containing salicylates shouldcheck with a physician before taking bismuth subsalicy-late. Anyone who has developed a rash or other unusualreactions after taking loperamide should not take thatdrug again without checking with a physician. The physi-cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING. Women who arepregnant or breastfeeding should check with their physi-cians before using antidiarrheal drugs. They should alsoask advice on how to replace lost fluids and salts.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before usingantidiarrheal drugs, people with any of these medicalproblems should make sure their physicians are aware oftheir conditions:• dysentery• gout• hemophilia or other bleeding problems• kidney disease• stomach ulcer• severe colitis• liver disease
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antidiarrhealdrugs with certain other drugs may affect the way thedrugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects of attapulgite are con-stipation, bloating, and fullness. Bismuth subsalicylatemay cause ringing in the ears, but that side effect is rare.Possible side effects from loperamide include skin rash,constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, dry mouth,nausea, vomiting, and swelling,pain, and discomfort inthe abdomen. Some of these symptoms are the same asthose that occur with diarrhea, so it may be difficult to tellif the medicine is causing the problems. Children may bemore sensitive than adults to certain side effects of lop-eramide, such as drowsiness and dizziness.Other rare side effects may occur with any antidiar-rheal medicine. Anyone who has unusual symptoms aftertaking an antidiarrhea drug should get in touch with hisor her physician.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)test
Definition
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test, also called theVasopressin test, is a test for the antidiuretic hormone,which is released from the pituitary gland and acts on thekidneys to increase their reabsorption of water into theblood.
Purpose
An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of dia- betes insipidusor the syndrome of inappropriate ADHcalled SIADH.
Precautions
Certain drugs can either increase or decrease ADHlevels. Drugs that increase ADH levels include aceta-KEY TERMS
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon (large bowel).Dehydration—Excessive loss of water from thebody.Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.Nutrient—A food substance that provides energyor is necessary for growth and repair. Examples ofnutrients are vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates,fats, and proteins.minophen,barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estrogen,nicotine, oral hypoglycemiaagents, some diuretics (e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tri-cyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levelsinclude alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine antag-onists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).
Description
The purpose of ADH is to control the amount ofwater reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continuallybeing taken into the body in food and drink, as well asbeing produced by chemical reactions in cells. Water isalso continually lost in urine, sweat, feces, and in thebreath as water vapor. ADH release helps maintain theoptimum amount of water in the body when there is anincrease in the concentration of the blood serum or adecrease in blood volume. Physical stress, surgery, andhigh levels of anxietycan also stimulate ADH.Various factors can affect ADH production, therebydisturbing the body’s water balance. For example, alcoholconsumption reduces ADH production by direct action onthe brain, resulting in a temporarily increased productionof urine. This may also occur in diabetes insipidus, whenthe pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely,when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverseeffect of water retention can result from temporarilyincreased ADH production after a major operation oraccident. Water retention may also be caused by thesecretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of the lung.
Preparation
The test requires collection of a blood sample. Thepatient must be fasting(nothing to eat or drink) for 12hours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical activityfor 10-12 hours before the test.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may includeslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
ADH normal ranges are laboratory-specific but canrange from 1-5 pg/ml or 1.5 ng/L (SI units).
Abnormal results
Patients who are dehydrated, who have a decreasedamount of blood in the body (hypovolemia), or who areundergoing severe physical stress (e.g., trauma, painor

Systemic antifungal drugs are medicines taken bymouth or by injection to treat deep infections caused by afungus.
Purpose
Systemic antifungal drugs are used to treat infec-tions in various parts of the body that are caused by aKEY TERMS
Diabetes insipidus—A metabolic disorder inwhich the pituitary gland produces inadequateamounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or thekidneys are unable to respond to release of thehormone. Primary symptoms are excessive urina-tion and constant thirst.Pituitary gland—The pituitary gland is sometimesreferred to as the “master gland.” As the most impor-tant of the endocrine glands (glands which releasehormones directly into the bloodstream), it regulatesand controls not only the activities of otherendocrine glands but also many body processes.fungus. A fungus is an organism that can be either one-celled or filamentous. Unlike a plant, which makes itsown food, or an animal, which eats plants or other ani-mals, a fungus survives by invading and living off otherliving things. Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, includ-ing some parts of the body.Fungal infections can either be systemic, meaningthat the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic),meaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on theskin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the mucousmembranes of the body. Fungal infections on the skin areusually treated with creams or ointments (topical antifun-gal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infectionsor topical infections that do not clear up after treatmentwith creams or ointments may need to be treated with sys-temic antifungal drugs. These drugs are used, for example,to treat common fungal infections such as tinea ( ring- worm), which occurs on the skin or candidiasis(a yeast infection, also known as trush), which can occur in thethroat, in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They arealso used to treat other deep fungal infections such ashistoplasmosis,blastomycosis, and aspergillosis, which can affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimesused to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whoseimmune systems are weakened, such as bone marrow ororgan transplant patients and people with AIDS.
Description
Antifungal drugs are categorized depending on theirroute or site of action, their mechanism of action andtheir chemical nature.Systemic antifungal drugs, such as capsofungin (Can-cidas), flucytosine, fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole(Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and miconazole(Monistat I.V .) are available only by prescription. They areavailable in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofantifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal infec-tion being treated. Doses may also be different for differ-ent patients. The prescribing physician or the pharmacistcan provide dosage information. Systemic antifungaldrugs must be taken exactly as directed. Itraconazole andketoconazole should be taken with food.Fungal infections can take a long time to clear up, soit may be necessary to take the medication for severalmonths, or even for a year or longer. It is very importantto keep taking the medicine for as long as the physiciansays to take it, even if symptoms seem to improve. If thedrug is stopped too soon, the symptoms may return.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 267Antifungal drugs, systemicGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 267Systemic antifungal drugs work best when theiramount is kept constant in the body, meaning that theyhave to be taken regularly, at the same time every day,and without missing any doses.Patients taking the liquid form of ketoconazoleshould use a specially marked medicine spoon or othermedicine measuring device to make sure they take thecorrect amount. A regular household teaspoon may nothold the right amount of medicine. Ask the pharmacistsabout ways to accurately measure the dose of these drugs.
Precautions
If symptoms do not improve within a few weeks, theprescribing physician should be informed.While taking this medicine, regular medical visitsshould be scheduled. The physician needs to keep check-ing for side effects throughout the antifungal therapy.Some people feel drowsy or dizzy while taking sys-temic antifungal drugs. Anyone who takes these drugsshould not drive, use machines or do anything else thatmight be dangerous until they have found out how thedrugs affect them.Liver problems, stomach problems and other prob-lems may occur in people who drink alcohol while takingsystemic antifungal drugs. Alcohol and prescription ornonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs that containalcohol should be avoided while taking antifungal drugs.(Medicines that may contain alcohol include some cough syrups, tonics, and elixirs.) Alcohol should be avoidedfor at least a day after taking an antifungal drug.The antifungal drug ketoconazole may make theeyes unusually sensitive to light. Wearing sunglasses andavoiding exposure to bright light may help.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake systemic antifungal drugs. Before taking thesedrugs, the prescribing physician should be informedabout any of the following conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions tosystemic antifungal drugs in the past should let his or herphysician know about the problem before taking the drugsagain. The physician should also be told about any aller- giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. In laboratory studies of animals, sys-temic antifungal drugs have caused birth defectsand other problems in the mother and fetus. Studies have notbeen done on pregnant women, so it is not knownwhether these drugs cause similar effects in people.Women who are pregnant or who plan to become preg-nant should check with their physicians before takingsystemic antifungal drugs. Any woman who becomespregnant while taking these drugs should let her physi-cian know immediately.BREASTFEEDING. Systemic antifungal drugs passinto breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding shouldcheck with their physicians before using systemic anti-fungal drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. People who havemedical conditions that deplete stomach acid (achlorhy-dria) or decrease stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) should besure to inform their physicians about their condition beforethey use a systemic antifungal drug. These drugs are notactive in their natural form, but must be converted to theactive form by an acid. If these is not enough stomach acid,the drugs will be ineffective. For people with insufficientstomach acid, it may help to take the medicine with anacidic drink, such as a cola. The patient’s health careprovider can suggest the best way to take the medicine.Before using systemic antifungal drugs, people withany of these medical problems should also make suretheir physicians are aware of their conditions:• current or past alcohol abuse• liver disease• kidney disease
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking systemic anti-fungal drugs with certain other drugs may affect the waythe drugs work or may increase the chance of sideeffects.
Side effects

Anyone who hasunusual symptoms after taking systemic antifungal drugsshould get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Serious and possibly life-threatening side effects canresult if the oral forms of itraconazole or ketoconazole orthe injectable form of miconazole are taken with certaindrugs. Do not take those types of systemic antifungaldrugs with any of the following drugs unless the physi-cian approves of the therapy:• astemizole (Hismanal)• cisapride (Propulsid)• antacids• theophylline-containing anti-wheezing medicationsTaking an acid blocker such as cimetidine (Taga-met), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), omeprazole(Prilosec), or ranitidine (Zantac) at the same time as asystemic antifungal drug may prevent the antifungal drugfrom working properly. For best results, take the acidblocker at least 2 hours after taking the antifungal drug.In addition, systemic antifungal drugs may interactwith many other medicines. When this happens, theeffects of one or both of the drugs may change or the riskof side effects may be greater.

Antifungal drugs, topical
Definition
Topical antifungal drugs are medicines applied tothe skin to treat skin infections caused by a fungus.
Purpose
Dermatologic fungal infections are usuallydescribed by their location on the body: tinea pedis(infection of the foot), tinea unguium (infection of thenails), tinia capitis (infection of the scalp.) Three types offungus are involved in most skin infections:Trichophy-ton, Epidermophyton,and Microsporum.Mild infectionsKEY TERMS
Elixir—A sweetened liquid that contains alcohol,water, and medicine.Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.Fungus—A unicellular to filamentous organismthat causes parasitic infections.Ointment—A thick substance that contains medi-cine and is meant to be spread on the skin, or if anophthalmic ointment, in the eye.Systemic—A term used to describe a medicinethat has effects throughout the body, as opposed totopical drugs that work on the skin. Most medi-cines that are taken by mouth or by injection aresystemic drugs.are usually susceptible to topical therapy, however severeor resistant infections may require systemic treatment.Description
There are a large number of drugs currently avail-able in topical form for fungal infections. Other than theimidazoles, (miconazole [Micatin, Miconazole], clotri-mazole [Lotrimin], econazole [Spectazole], ketoconazole[Nizoral], oxiconazole [Oxistat], sulconazole [Exel-derm]) and the allylamine derivatives (butenafine [Men-tax], naftifine [Naftin], terbinafine [Lamisil]), the drugsin this therapeutic class are chemically distinct from eachother. All drugs when applied topically have a good mar-gin of safety, and most show a high degree of effective-ness. There are no studies comparing drugs on which tobase a recommendation for drugs of choice. Althoughsome of the topical antifungals are available over-the-counter, they may be as effective as prescription drugsfor this purpose.Traditional antifungal drugs such as undecylinicacid (Cruex, Desenex) and gentian violet (also known ascrystal violet) remain available, but have a lower curerate (complete eradication of fungus) than the neweragents and are not recommended. Tolnaftate (Tinactin)has a lower cure rate than the newer drugs, but may beused prophylactically to prevent infection.
Recommended dosage
All drugs are applied topically. Consult individualproduct information for specific application recommen-dations.As with all topical products, selection of the dosageform may be as important as proper drug selection. Con-sider factors such as presence or absence of hair on theaffected area, and type of skin to which the medication isto be applied. Thin liquids may preferable for applicationto hairy areas, creams for the hands and face, and oint-ments may be preferable for the trunk and legs. Otherdosage forms available include shampoos and sprays.Ciclopirox and triacetin are available in formulations fortopical treatment of nail fungus as well as skin infections(ciclopirox as Penlac Nail Lacquer and triacetin as Ony-Clear Nail).Most topical antifungal drugs require four weeks oftreatment. Infections in some areas, particularly thespaces between toes, may take up to six weeks for cure.
Precautions
Most topical antifungal agents are well tolerated.The most common adverse effects are localized irritationcaused by the vehicle or its components. This may

Somedirect allergic reactions are possible.Topical antifungal drugs should only be applied inaccordance with labeled uses. They are not intended orophthalmic (eye) or otic (ear) use. Application to mucousmembranes should be limited to appropriate formulations.The antifungal drugs have not been evaluated forsafety in pregnancyand lactationon topical applicationunder the pregnancy risk category system.

Creams may be moreappropriate than ointments for application toexposed skin areas such as the face and hands.Ointment—A thick, spreadable substance thatcontains medicine and is meant to be used on theskin, or if a vaginal preparation, in the vagina.Opthalmic—Pertaining to the eye.Otic—Pertaining to the ear.Topical—A term used to describe medicine thathas effects only in a specific area, not throughoutthe body, particularly medicine that is put directlyon the skin.foods, such as beans, grains, and vegetables is onecause. Some people unconsciously swallow air whenthey eat, drink, chew gum, or smoke cigarettes, whichcan lead to uncomfortable amounts of gas in the diges-tive system. Surgery and certain medical conditions,such as irritable colon, peptic ulcer, and diverticulosis,can also lead to gas build-up. Certain intestinal parasitescan contribute to the production of severe gas - theseparasites need to be treated separately with specialdrugs. Abdominal pain, pressure, bloating, and flatu-lence are signs of too much gas. Antigas agents helprelieve the symptoms by preventing the formation of gaspockets and breaking up gas that already is trapped inthe stomach and intestines.
Description
Antigas agents are sold as capsules, liquids, andtablets (regular and chewable) and can be bought withouta physician’s prescription. Some commonly used brandsare Gas-X, Flatulex, Mylanta Gas Relief, Di-Gel, andPhazyme. The ingredient that helps relieve excess gas issimethicone. Simethicone does not relieve acid indiges- tion, but some products also contain antacidsfor that purpose. Check the label of the product or ask the phar-macist for more information.
Recommended dosage
Check the product container for dosing informa-tion. Typically, the doses should be taken after mealsand at bedtime. Chewable forms should be chewedthoroughly.Check with a physician before giving this medicineto children under age 12 years.
Precautions
Some anti-gas medicines may contain sugar, sodi-um, or other ingredients. Anyone who is on a special dietor is allergic to any foods, dyes, preservatives, or othersubstances should check with his or her physician orpharmacist before using any of these products.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to sime-thicone—the active ingredient in antigas medicines—should check with his or her physician before takingthese drugs.

Antigastroesophageal refluxdrugs
Definition
These drugs are used to treat gastroesophagealreflux, the backward flow of stomach contents into theesophagus.
Purpose
The drug discussed here, cisapride (Propulsid), isused to treat nighttime heartburnresulting from gas-troesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this condition,food and stomach juices flow backward from the stom-ach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive tractthrough which food passes on its way from the mouth tothe stomach. Normally, a muscular ring called the loweresophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food into thestomach and then closes to prevent the stomach’s con-tents from flowing back into the esophagus. In peoplewith GERD, this muscular ring is either weak or it relax-es at the wrong times. The main symptom is heartburn—a burning sensation centered behind the breastbone andspreading upward toward the neck and throat.Cisapride works by strengthening the loweresophageal sphincter and making the stomach emptymore quickly. This shortens the amount of time that theesophagus comes in contact with the stomach contents.KEY TERMS
Digestive tract—The stomach, intestines, andother parts of the body through which food passes.Diverticulosis—A condition in which the colon(large intestine) develops a number of outpouch-ings or sacs.Flatulence—Excess gas in the digestive tract.Irritable colon—An intestinal disorder oftenaccompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea.Other drugs, such as H2-blockers are sometimes pre-scribed to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.Description
Cisapride is available only with a physician’s pre-scription. Cisapride is sold in tablet and liquid forms.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the patient. The average dosefor adults and children age 12 and over is 5-20 mg takentwo to four times a day. The medicine should be taken 15minutes before meals and at bedtime. For children under12, the dose is based on body weight and should bedetermined by the child’s physician.
Precautions
This medicine is effective in treating only nighttimeheartburn, not daytime heartburn.Cisapride may increase the effects of alcohol andtranquilizers.Cisapride has caused dangerous irregular heartbeatsin a few people who took it with other medicines. Any-one who takes this drug should let the physician know allother medicines he or she is taking. Patients with heartproblems should check with their physicians before tak-ing cisapride.Anyone who has bleeding, blockage, or leakage inthe stomach or intestines should not take cisapride. Cis-apride should not be used by anyone who has had anunusual reaction to the drug in the past. In addition, peo-ple with any of the following medical problems shouldmake sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:• epilepsy or history of seizures• kidney disease• liver diseaseThe effects of taking cisapride during pregnancyhave not been fully studied. Women who are pregnant orplan to become pregnant should check with their physi-cians before taking Cisapride. The drug passes intobreast milk and may affect nursing babies. Women whoare breastfeeding and need to take this medicine shouldcheck with their physicians. Avoiding breastfeedingwhile taking the drug may be necessary.
Side effects
The most common side effects are abdominal pain, bloating, gas,diarrhea,constipation, nausea, upper res-piratory infections, inflammation of the nasal passages
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 272Antigastroesophageal reflux drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 272and sinuses,headache, and viral infections. Other sideeffects may occur. Anyone who has unusual or trouble-some symptoms after taking this drug should get in touchwith his or her physician.
Interactions
Cisapride may interact with a variety of other medi-cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both ofthe drugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Anyone who takes Cisapride should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with cisapride are:• antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole (Nizoral),miconazole (Monistat), and fluconazole (Diflucan)• antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and ery-thromycin (E-Mycin, ERYC)• blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin)• H2-blockers such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and raniti-dine (Zantac)• tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diaz-epam (Valium), and alprazolam (Xanax)The list above does not include every drug that mayinteract with cisapride.

Definition
Antihelminthic drugs are used to treat parasiticinfestations.
Purpose
Parasitic infestations are caused by protozoa orworms gaining entry into the body. Most of these organ-isms cause infections by being ingested in the form ofeggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated food orclothing, while others gain entry through skin abrasions.Common parasitic infestations include amebiasis,malar- ia,giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm, threadworm, whip-worm and tapeworm infestations. Once in the body, para-sitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severesymptoms. However, if they multiply rapidly and spread toa major organ, they can cause very serious and even life-threatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are pre-scribed to treat these infestations. They function either bydestroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them, orby altering the permeability of their plasma membranes.The dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces.
Description
Antihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre-scription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules.Some commonly used antihelminthics include: albenda-zole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide(Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel (Biltri-cide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate (Antiminth)and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types of parasiticinfestations are rarely seen in the United States, thus, thecorresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely dis-tributed and need to be obtained from the United StatesCenter for Disease Control (CDC) when required. Theseinclude for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treatonchocerciasis infestations. Other antihelminthic drugs,such as diethylcarbamazepine citrate (Hetrezan), usedfor treatment of roundworms and other parasites, is sup-plied directly by its manufacturer when needed.Most antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe-cific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, theparasites must therefore be identified using tests that lookfor parasites, eggs or larvae in feces, urine, blood, sputum,or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is used against tapeworms,but will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm orroundworm infestations, because it acts by inhibiting ATPproduction in tapeworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole)is the drug usually prescribed for treatment of thread-worm, but a similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works

Pinworm isendemic in both temperate and tropical regions andcommon especially in school age children.Onchocerciasis—Parasitic infestation caused by fil-amentous worms of the genus Onchocerca, espe-cially O. volvulus, that is found in tropical Americaand is transmitted by several types of blackflies.Protozoan—Any unicellular or multicellular organ-ism containing nuclei and organelles (eukaryotic) ofthe subkingdom Protozoa.Roundworm—Any round-bodied unsegmentedworm as distinguished from a flatworm. Also calleda nematode, they look similar to the common earth-worm.Tapeworm—Flat and very long (up to 30 meters)intestinal parasitic worms, similar to a long piece oftape. Common tapeworms include: T. saginata (beeftapeworm), T. solium (pork tapeworm) D. latum(fish tapeworm), H. Nana (dwarf tapeworm) and E.granulosus (dog tapeworm). General symptoms arevague abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea and weight loss.Threadworm—Any long, thin nematode worm.Trematode—Any parasitic flatworm of the classTrematoda, as the liver fluke.Whipworm—A nematode worm of the familyTrichuridae with a body that is thick at one end andvery long and slender at the other end.treated. The number of doses per day, the time betweendoses, and the length of treatment will also depend onthese factors.Antihelminthic drugs must be taken exactly asdirected to completely rid the body of the parasitic infes-tation, and for as long as directed. A second round oftreatment may be required to ensure that the infection hascompletely cleared.

Some antihelminthic drugs work best when ingestedalong with fatty foods, such as milk or ice cream. Oraldrugs should be taken with water during or after meals.The prescribing physician should be informed if thepatient has a low-fat or other special diet.Some antihelminthic drugs, such as praziquantel,come in chewable form. These tablets should not bechewed or kept in the mouth, but should swallowed wholebecause their bitter taste may cause gagging or vomiting.Antihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be takenwith other medications. For example, steroids such asprednisone are also prescribed together with the anti-helminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflamma-tion that the worm may cause.When required, pre- or post-treatment purges arealso performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate.Regular medical visits are recommended for peopleaffected by parasitic infestations. The physician monitorswhether the infection is clearing or not and also keepstrack of unwanted side effects. The prescribing physicianshould be informed if symptoms do not disappear or ifthey get worse.Hookworm or whipworm infections are also treatedwith iron supplements along with the antihelminthic pre-scription.Some types of parasitic infestations (e.g. pinworms)can be passed from one person to another. It is then oftenrecommended that everyone in the household of aninfected person be asked to also take the prescribed anti-helminthic drug.
Risks
People with the following medical conditions mayhave adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs. The pre-scribing physician should accordingly be informed if anyof these conditions are present:•Allergies. Anyone who has had adverse reactions toantihelminthic drugs should inform the prescribingphysician before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be informed about any other pre-existingallergies.• Ulcers. Antihelminthic drugs are also contraindicatedfor persons diagnosed with ulcers of the digestive tract,especially ulcerative colitis.•Pregnancy. There is research evidence reporting thatsome antihelminthic drugs cause birth defectsor mis- carriagein animal studies. No human birth defects havebeen reported, but antihelminthic drugs are usually notrecommended for use during pregnancy. Pregnant womenshould accordingly inform the prescribing physician.• Breastfeeding. Some antihelminthic drugs can pass intobreast milk. Breastfeeding may have to be discontinueduntil the antihelminthic treatment has ended and breast-feeding mothers must also inform the prescribingphysician.• Other risk conditions. Any of the following medicalconditions should also be reported to the prescribingphysician:Crohn’s disease, liver disease, kidney dis-ease and worm cysts in the eyes.Common side effects of antihelminthic drugs includedizziness, drowsiness,headache, sweating, dryness of themouth and eyes, and ringing in the ears. Anyone takingthese drugs should accordingly avoid driving, operatingmachines or other activities that may be dangerous untilthey know how they are affected by the drugs. Side effectsusually wear off as the body adjusts to the drug and do notusually require medical treatment. Thiabendazole maycause the urine to have an unusual odor that can last for aday after the last dose. Other side effects of antihelminthicdrugs, such as loss of appetite,diarrhea, nausea, vomit-ing, or abdominal cramps are less common. If they occur,they are usually mild and do not require medical attention.More serious side effects, such as fever, chills, con-fusion, extreme weakness,hallucinations, severe diar-rhea, nausea or vomiting, skin rashes,low back pain, dark urine, blurred vision, seizures, and jaundicehave been reported in some cases. The patient’s physicianshould be informed immediately if any should develop.As a rule, anyone who has unusual symptoms after start-ing treatment with antihelminthic drugs should notify theprescribing physician.Antihelminthic drugs may interact with each otheror with other drugs, whether prescribed or not. For exam-ple, it has been reported that use of the antihelminthicdrugs pyrantel and piperazine together lowers the effi-ciency of pyrantel. Similarly, combining a given anti-helminthic drug with another medication may increasethe risk of side effects from either drug.Nancy Ross-Flanigan
Antihemorrhoid drugs
Definition
Antihemorrhoid drugs are medicines that reduce theswelling and relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids(swellings in the area around the anus).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 275Antihemorrhoid drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 275Purpose
Hemorrhoids are bulges in the veins that supplyblood to the skin and membranes of the area around theanus. They may form for various reasons. Frequent heavylifting, sitting for long periods, or straining to have bowelmovements may put stresson anal tissues, which can leadto hemorrhoids. Some women develop hemorrhoids dur-ing pregnancyas the expanding uterus puts pressure onthe anal tissues. The strain of labor and delivery can alsocause hemorrhoids or make existing hemorrhoids worse.Hemorrhoids sometimes result from certain medicalproblems, such as tumors pressing on the lower bowel.The main symptoms of hemorrhoids are bleedingfrom the rectum, especially after a bowel movement, anditching, burning,pain, and general discomfort in theanal area. Over-the-counter antihemorrhoid products canrelieve many of these symptoms. The products containcombinations of four main types of ingredients:• local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine andtetracaine, to temporarily relieve the pain• vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine base, epinephrinehydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate and phenylephrinehydrochloride that reduce swelling and relieve itchingand discomfort by tightening blood vessels• astringents (drying agents), such as witch hazel,calamine, and zinc oxide. These help shrink hemor-rhoids by pulling water out of the swollen tissue. This,in turn, helps relieve itching, burning, and irritation.• protectants, such as cocoa butter, lanolin, glycerin, min-eral oil, and shark liver oil which soothe irritated tissuesand form a protective barrier to prevent further irrita-tion
Description
Antihemorrhoid drugs are available as creams, oint-ments and suppositories. Most can be bought without aphysician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
Follow package instructions for using these prod-ucts. Do not use more than the recommended amount ofthis medicine every day. For explanations or furtherinformation about how to use antihemorrhoid drugs,check with a physician or pharmacist.
Precautions
Do not use antihemorrhoid drugs for more thanseven days in a row. If the problem gets worse or doesnot improve, check with a physician.KEY TERMS
Anus—The opening at the end of the intestinethrough which solid waste (stool) passes as itleaves the body.Rectum—The end of the intestine closest to theanus.Uterus—A hollow organ in a female in which afetus develops until birth.If rectal bleeding continues, check with a physician.This could be a sign of a condition that needs medicalattention.
Side effects
Side effects are rare, however, if a rash or any othersign of an allergic reaction occurs, stop using the medicine.
Interactions
Some antihemorrhoid drugs should not be used bypeople who are taking or have recently taken monoamineoxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors), such as phenelzine(Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate), used to treat condi-tions including depression and Parkinson’s disease. Anyone who is not sure if he or she has taken this type ofdrug should check with a physician or pharmacist beforeusing an antihemorrhoid drug. People who are takingantidepressants or medicine for high blood pressure alsoshould not use certain antihemorrhoid drugs. Check witha pharmacist for a list of drugs that may interact with spe-cific antihemorrhoid drugs.Nancy Ross-Flanigan
Antihistamines
Definition
Antihistamines are drugs that block the action ofhistamine (a compound released in allergic inflammatoryreactions) at the H
1receptor sites, responsible for imme-diate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing anditching. Members of this class of drugs may also be usedfor their side effects, including sedationand antiemesis(prevention of nausea and vomiting).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 276AntihistaminesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 276Purpose
Antihistamines provide their primary action byblocking histamine H
1at the receptor site. They have noeffect on rate of histamine release, nor do they inactivatehistamine. By inhibiting the activity of histamine, theycan reduce capillary fragility, which produces the erythe-ma, or redness, associated with allergic reactions. Theywill also reduce histamine-induced secretions, includingexcessive tears and salivation. Additional effects varywith the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs,called first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selec-tively to H
1receptors in the central nervous system aswell as to peripheral receptors, and can produce sedation,inhibition of nausea and vomiting, and reduction ofmotion sickness. The second-generation antihistaminesbind only to peripheral H
1receptors, and reduce allergicresponse with little or no sedation.The first-generation antihistamines may be dividedinto several chemical classes. The side effect profile,which also determines the uses of the drugs, will vary bychemical class. The alkylamines include brompheni-ramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trime-ton.) These agents cause relatively little sedation, and areused primarily for treatment of allergic reactions. Promet-hazine (Phenergan), in contrast, is a phenothiazine, chem-ically related to the major tranquilizers, and while it isused for treatment of allergies, may also be used as asedative, the relieve anxietyprior to surgery, as an anti-nauseant, and for control of motion sickness. Diphenhy-dramine (Benadryl) is chemically an ethanolamine, and inDANIELE BOVET (1907–1992)
A gifted researcher in therapeutic chemistry,Daniele Bovet was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, oneof four children of a professor of experimental educa-tion. Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomyat the University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of sci-ence degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Insti-tute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory ofTherapeutic Chemistry in 1936.Bovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller-gy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, soBovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub—began studying substances that blocked hormones simi-lar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first anti-histamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substancewas too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performedthousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihista-mines. This work formed the basis for the developmentof subsequent clinically useful antihistamines.
addition to its role in reducing allergic reactions, may beused as a nighttime sedative, for control of drug-inducedParkinsonism, and, in liquid form, for control of coughs.Consult more detailed references for further information.The second generation antihistamines have no cen-tral action, and are used only for treatment of allergicreactions. These are divided into two chemical classes.Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a piperazine derivative, and has aslight sedative effect. Loratidine (Claritin) and fexofena-dine (Allegra) are members of the piperadine class andare essentially non-sedating.
Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, patient and intended use.Consult more detailed references for further information.When used for control of allergic reactions, antihista-mines should be taken on a regular schedule, rather than onan as-needed basis, since they have no effect on histamineitself, nor on histamine already bound to the receptor site.Efficacy is highly variable from patient to patient. Ifan antihistamine fails to provide adequate relief, switchto a drug from a different chemical class. Individualdrugs may be effective in no more than 40% of patients,and provide 50% relief of allergic symptoms.

Antihypertensive drugs
Definition
Antihypertensive drugs are medicines that helplower blood pressure.
Purpose
The overall class of antihypertensive agents lowersblood pressure, although the mechanisms of action varygreatly. Within this therapeutic class, there are severalsubgroups. There are a very large number of drugs used tocontrol hypertension, and the drugs listed below are rep-resentatives, but not the only members of their classes.The calcium channel blocking agents, also calledslow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit themovement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane.This reduces the force of contraction of muscles of theheart and arteries. Although the calcium channel block-ersare treated as a group, there are four different chemi-cal classes, leading to significant variations in the activi-ty of individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) hasthe greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil(Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greatereffect on the heart muscle itself.Peripheral vasodilatorssuch as hydralazine(Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil(Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels.There are several groups of drugs which act by reduc-ing adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory nervestimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in thearteries, veins, and heart. These drugs include the beta-adrenergic blockers and alpha/beta adrenergic blockers.There are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents.Beta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol(Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol (Visken).Propranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic receptors any-where in the body, and has been used as a treatment foremotional anxietyand rapid heart beat. Atenolol andacebutolol (Sectral) act specifically on the nerves of theheart and circulation.There are two alpha/beta adrenergic blockers,labetolol (Normodyne, Trandate) and carvedilol (Coreg).These work similarly to the beta blockers.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACE inhibitors) act by inhibiting the production of angiotensinII, a substance that both induces constriction of bloodvessels and retention of sodium, which leads to waterretention and increased blood volume. There are 10 ACEinhibitors currently marketed in the United States,including captopril (Capoten), benazepril (Lotensin),enalapril (Vasotec), and quinapril (Acupril). The primarydifference between these drugs is their onset and dura-tion of action.The ACE II inhibitors, losartan (Cozaar), candesar-tan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan(Micardis), valsartan (Diovan) and eprosartan (Teveten)directly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blockingits production. Their actions are similar to the ACEinhibitors, but they appear to have a more favorable sideeffect and safety profile.In addition to these drugs, other classes of drugshave been used to lower blood pressure, most notably thethiazide diuretics. There are 12 thiazide diuretics mar-keted in the United States, including hydrochlorothiazide(Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide(Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). Thedrugs in this class appear to lower blood pressurethrough several mechanisms. By promoting sodium lossthey lower blood volume. At the same time, the pressureof the walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascularresistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonlyused as the first choice for reduction of mild hyperten-sion, and may be used in combination with other antihy-pertensive drugs.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage varies with patient, drug,severity of hypertension, and whether the drug is beingused alone or in combination with other drugs. Consultspecialized references for further information.
Precautions
Because of the large number of classes and individ-ual drugs in this group, consult specialized references forcomplete information.Peripheral vasodilators may cause dizzinessand orthostatic hypotension—a rapid lowering of blood pres-sure when the patient stands up in the morning. Patients

Pregnancyrisk factors for this group are gener-ally category C. Hydralazine has been shown to causecleft palate in animal studies, but there is no human dataavailable. Breastfeeding is not recommended.ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, butmay rarely cause dangerous reactions including laryn-gospasm and angioedema. Persistent coughis a com- mon side effect. ACE inhibitors should not be used inpregnancy. When used in pregnancy during the secondand third trimesters, angiotension-converting inhibitors(ACEIs) can cause injury to and even deathin the devel-oping fetus. When pregnancy is detected, discontinuethe ACE inhibitor as soon as possible. Breastfeeding isnot recommended.ACE II inhibitors are generally well tolerated and donot cause cough. Pregnancy risk factor is category C dur-ing the first trimester and category D during the secondand third trimesters. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidi-ty and death when administered to pregnant women. Sev-eral dozen cases have been reported in patients who weretaking ACE inhibitors. When pregnancy is detected, dis-continue AIIRAs as soon as possible. Breast feeding isnot recommended.Thiazide diuretics commonly cause potassium deple-tion. Patients should have potassium supplementationeither through diet, or potassium supplements.

Definition
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs are used to treat hyper-uricemia, the state of having too much uric acid in theblood.
Purpose
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs decrease the levels of uricacid in the blood, either by increasing the rate at whichuric acid is excreted in the urine, or by preventing theformation of excess uric acid.
Precautions
Before taking any medication, patients should notifytheir physician of all other medications that they are cur-rently taking. Patients should also notify their physicianof any health problems they are currently experiencing.Patients must notify physicians if they have kidney prob-lems, since this might affect the type of drug adminis-tered. Patients must also notify their physician if they areallergic to any of the medications used to treat acute orlong-term gout. Since all of these factors contribute tothe disease, patients suffering from gout should attemptto lose weight, avoid excess alcohol consumption, andavoid foods high in purines, such as asparagus, sardines,lobster, avocado, and peas.
Description
Gout and hyperuricemiaPersons with high levels of uric acid (hyper-uricemia) may experience gout. Commonly gout occursin males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by theattacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is oftenaccompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints. Themost common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney stones, and/or poor kidney function may also be associ-ated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered goutif the patient does not have painful joints. In persons withgout (and associated symptoms), uric acid forms crystals,which then cause the aforementioned symptoms.Although uric acid levels must be high in order forpatients to have crystals form, and therefore have gout,most persons with high uric acid levels don’t ever havesymptoms. Thus, recent criteria for use of anti-hyper-uricemic agents suggest that patients who have neverexperienced symptoms of gout should not receive drugtherapy, unless their hyperuricemia is associated withcancer(may lead to kidney damage) or certain rare
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 281Anti-hyperuricemic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 281genetic disorders (McGill, Rheumatologist, University ofSydney, Australia, 2000).Acute gout attacksWhen patients experience acute attacks of gout, drugsthat lower the levels of uric acid can cause an acute goutattack or cause an attack to become more severe. Thus,drugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat goutin the long term are not used in the short term. Medica-tions used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin), colchicine,and corticosteroids. Colchicine causes side effects in alarge number of individuals (usually diarhhea). The mostimportant factor in the effective treatment of gout may notbe the drug used, but how quickly it is administered afteran acute attack has begun.Long-term treatmentLong-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia usu-ally involves one of four drugs: allopurinol, probenicid,sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone (as of this printingin 2001, benzbromarone is not available for use in theUnited States). While allopurinol decreases the amountof uric acid that is produced (and may help prevent acuteattacks of gout), the other drugs all increase the rate atwhich uric acid is excreted in the urine. As previouslymentioned, lowering the concentration of uric acid cancause gout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medica-tions should have the dose slowly increased (and uricacid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute attacks ofgout. Patients may also be treated with colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent acuteattacks of gout (corticosteroids are not used in this sce-nario because over the long term corticosteroids havedeleterious side effects).Michael V Zuck, PhD
Anti-insomnia drugs
Definition
Anti-insomnia drugs are medicines that help peoplefall asleep or stay asleep.
Purpose
Physicians prescribe anti-insomnia drugs for short-term treatment of insomnia—a sleep problem in whichpeople have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep orwake up too early and can’t go back to sleep. These drugsshould be used only for occasional treatment of tempo-rary sleep problems and should not be taken for more thana week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems lastlonger than this should see a physician. Their sleep prob-lems could be a sign of another medical problem.
Description
The anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem(Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system(CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines thatslow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe medi-cines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam(Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), esta-zolam (ProSom), and temazepam (Restoril), for insom- nia. Benzodiazepine drugs are described in the essay onantianxiety drugs. Zaleplon (Sonata) is another anti-insomnia drug that is not related to other drugs with thesame effect. The barbiturates, such as pentobarbital(Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longercommonly used to treat insomnia because they are toodangerous if they are taken in overdoses. For patientswith mild insomnia, some antihistamines, such asdiphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax)may be used, since these also cause sleepiness.Zolpidem is available only with a physician’s pre-scription and comes in tablet form.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg justbefore bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often within20 minutes, so it should be taken right before going to bed.For older people and others who may be more sensi-tive to the drug’s effects, the recommended startingdosage is 5 mg just before bedtime.Never take more than 10 mg of zolpidem in one 24-hour period. Overdoses can lead to excessive sleepinessor coma.Zolpidem may be taken with food or on an emptystomach, but it may work faster when taken on an emptystomach. Check with a physician or pharmacists forinstructions on how to take the medicine.
Precautions
Zolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment ofinsomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to 10days, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep prob-lems could be a sign of another medical problem. Also,this drug may lose its effectiveness when taken everynight for more than a few weeks.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 282Anti-insomnia drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 282Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, light-headed, or less alert the morning after they have takenzolpidem. The medicine may also cause clumsiness,unsteadiness, double vision, or other vision problems thenext day. For these reasons, anyone who takes thesedrugs should not drive, use machines or do anything elsethat might be dangerous until they have found out howzolpidem affects them.This medicine has caused cause behavior changes insome people, similar to those seen in people whosebehavior changes when they drink alcohol. Examplesinclude giddiness and rage. More extreme changes, suchas confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, also are pos-sible. Anyone who starts having strange or unusualthoughts or behavior while taking this medicine shouldget in touch with his or her physician.Zolpidem and other sleep medicines may cause aspecial type of temporary memory loss, in which the per-son does not remember what happens between the timethey take the medicine and the time its effects wear off.This is usually not a problem, because people go to sleepright after taking the medicine and stay asleep until itseffects wear off. But it could be a problem for anyonewho has to wake up before getting a full night’s sleep(seven to eight hours). In particular, travelers should nottake this medicine on airplane flights of less than sevento eight hours.Because zolpidem works work on the central ner-vous system, it may add to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some painrelievers, and muscle relaxants. Zolpidem may also add to theeffects of anesthetics, including those used for dentalprocedures. The combined effects of zolpidem and alco-hol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the centralnervous system) can be very dangerous, leading tounconsciousness or even death. People who take zolpi-dem should not drink alcohol and should check with theirphysicians before taking any other CNS depressant. Any-one who shows signs of an overdose or of the effects ofcombining zolpidem drugs with alcohol or other drugsshould have immediate emergency help. Warning signsinclude severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting,breathing problems, and staggering.Anyone who takes zolpidem for more than one totwo weeks should not stop taking it without first check-ing with a physician. Stopping the drug abruptly maycause rebound insomnia; increased difficulty fallingasleep for the first one of two nights after the drug hasbeen discontinued. In rare cases, withdrawal symptoms,such as vomiting, cramps, and unpleasant feelings mayoccur. Gradual tapering may be necessary.Older people may be more sensitive to the effects ofzolpidem. This may increase the chance of side effects,such as confusion, and may also increase the risk offalling.In people with breathing problems, zolpidem mayworsen the symptoms.Special conditionsPeople with certain other medical conditions or whoare taking certain other medicines can have problems ifthey take zolpidem. Before taking this medicine, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto zolpidem in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes,preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physiciansabout the safety of using zolpidem during pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeedingshould check with their physicians before using zolpi-dem.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using zolpi-dem, people with any of these medical problems shouldmake sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:• chronic lung diseases (emphysema,asthma, or chron-ic bronchitis)

Anti-itch drugs
Definition
Anti-itch drugs are medicines taken by mouth or byinjection to relieve itching.
Purpose
The medicine described here, hydroxyzine, is a typeof antihistamine used to relieve itching caused by allergic
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 284Anti-itch drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 284reactions. An allergic reaction occurs when the body isunusually sensitive to some substance, such as pollen,dust, mold, or certain foods or medicine. The body reactsby releasing a chemical called histamine that causes itch-ing and other symptoms, such as sneezing and wateryeyes. Antihistaminesreduce the symptoms by blockingthe effects of histamine.Hydroxyzine is also prescribed for anxietyand to helppeople relax before or after having general anesthesia.
Description
Anti-itch drugs, also called antipruritic drugs, areavailable only with a physician’s prescription and come intablet and injectable forms. Some commonly used brandsof the anti-itch drug hydroxyzine are Atarax and Vistaril.
Recommended dosage
When prescribed for itching, the usual dosage foradults is 25 mg, three to four times a day. For childrenover six years of age, the usual dosage 50-100 mg perday, divided into several small doses. The usual dosagefor children under six years of age is 50 mg per day,divided into several small doses.The dosage may be different for different people.Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or thepharmacist who filled the prescription for the correctdosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed.
Precautions
This medicine should not be used for more than fourmonths at a time because its effects can wear off. See aphysician regularly while taking the medicine to deter-mine whether it is still needed.Hydroxyzine may add to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as other antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medi-cine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, somepainrelievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone takinghydroxyzine should not drink alcohol and should checkwith his or her physician before taking any of the above.Some people feel drowsy or less alert when usingthis medicine. Anyone who takes it should not drive, usemachines, or do anything else that might be dangerousuntil they have found out how the drugs affect them.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to hydrox-yzine in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the medicine again. The physician shouldalso be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preserva-tives, or other substances.KEY TERMS
Anesthesia—Treatment with medicine that causesa loss of feeling, especially pain. Local anesthesianumbs only part of the body; general anesthesiacauses loss of consciousness.Antihistamine—Medicine that prevents or relievesallergy symptoms.A woman who is pregnant or who may becomepregnant should check with her physician before takingthis medicine. In studies of laboratory animals, hydrox-yzine has caused birth defectswhen taken during preg- nancy. Although the drug’s effects on pregnant womenhave not been fully studied, physicians advise againsttaking it in early pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeedingshould also check with their physicians before usinghydroxyzine. The medicine may pass into breast milkand may cause problems in nursing babies whose moth-ers take it.
Side effects
The most common side effect, drowsiness, usuallygoes away as the body adjusts to the drug. If it does not,reducing the dosage may be necessary. Other sideeffects, such as dry mouth, also may occur and do notneed medical attention unless they continue.More serious side effects are not common, but mayoccur. If any of the following side effects occur, checkwith the physician who prescribed the medicine as soonas possible:• twitches or tremors• convulsions (seizures)
Interactions
Hydroxyzine may interact with other medicines.When this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Anyone who takes hydroxyzine should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with hydroxyzine are:• barbiturates such as phenobarbital and secobarbital(Seconal)• opioid (narcotic) pain medicines such as meperidine(Demerol) and oxycodone (Percocet)

Antimalarial drugs
Definition
Antimalarial drugs are medicines that prevent ortreat malaria.
Purpose
Antimalarial drugs treat or prevent malaria, a diseasethat occurs in tropical, subtropical, and some temperateregions of the world. The disease is caused by a parasite,Plasmodium, which belongs to a group of one-celledorganisms known as protozoa. The only way to getmalaria is to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito thathas bitten someone who has the disease.Thanks to mos-quito control programs, malaria has been eliminated inthe United States, almost all of Europe, and large parts ofCentral and South America. However, mosquito controlhas not worked well in other parts of the world, andmalaria continues to be a major health problem in partsof Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Haiti, theDominican Republic, and some Pacific Islands. Everyyear, some 30,000 Americans and Europeans who travelto these areas get malaria. People planning to travel tothe tropics are often advised to take antimalarial drugsbefore, during, and after their trips, to help them avoidgetting the disease and bringing it home with them.These drugs kill Plasmodiumor prevent its growth.In recent years, some strains of Plasmodiumhave become resistant to antimalarial drugs, and medicalresearchers have stepped up efforts to develop a malariavaccine. In early1997, researchers reported encouragingresults from a small study of one vaccine and planned totest the vaccine in Africa.
Description
Antimalarial drugs are available only with a physi-cian’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, andinjectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalari-al drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine (Lariam),primaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), and quinine.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of anti-malarial drug, its strength, and the form in which it isbeing used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage mayalso be different for different people. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always takethis medicine exactly as directed, and keep taking it forthe full time of treatment. If the drug is being taken totreat malaria, do not stop taking it just because symptomsbegin to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug isstopped too soon. Never take larger or more frequentdoses than the physician has ordered, and do not take thedrug for longer than directed.Travelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria maybe told to take it for one to two weeks before their trip andfor 4 weeks afterward, as well as for the whole time theyare away. It is important to follow these directions.Antimalarial drugs work best when they are taken ona regular schedule. When taken once a week to preventmalaria, they should be taken on the same day everyweek. When taken daily or several times a day to treatmalaria, they should be taken at the same time every day.Doses should not be missed or skipped.Some antimalarial drugs should be taken with mealsor with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others must betaken with a full glass of water. Be sure to follow direc-tions for the best way to take the drug that is prescribed.
Precautions
Antimalarial drugs may cause lightheadedness,dizziness, blurred vision and other vision changes. Any-one who takes these drugs should not drive, use machinesor do anything else thatmight be dangerous until theyhave found out how the drugs affect them.The antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) hasreceived attention because of reports that it causes panicattacks,hallucinations,anxiety, depression,paranoia, and other mental and mood changes, sometimes lastingfor months after the last dose. A study published in 1996in the British Medical Journalnoted that about one in 140travelers who take the drug may have mental or moodchanges severe enough to interfere with normal activities.This compares to about one in 1,100 patients who havesuch reactions to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Any-one who has unexplained anxiety, depression, restless-ness, confusion, or other troubling mental or moodchanges after taking mefloquine should call a physician
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 286Antimalarial drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 286right away. Switching to a different antimalarial drug maybe an alternative and can allow the side effects to stop.Anyone taking antimalarial drugs to prevent malariawho develops a feveror flu-like symptoms while takingthe medicine or within two to three months after travel-ing to an area where malaria is common should call aphysician immediately.If the medicine is being taken to treat malaria, andsymptoms stay the same or get worse, check with thephysician who prescribed the medicine.Patients who take this medicine over a long timeneed to have a physician check them periodically forunwanted side effects.Babies and children are especially sensitive to theantimalarial drug chloroquine. Not only are they morelikely to have side effects from the medicine, but they arealso at greater risk of being harmed by an overdose. Asingle 300-mg tablet could kill a small child. Keep this medicine out of the reach of children. Use safety vials.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems ifthey take antimalarial drugs. Before taking these drugs,be sure to let the physician know about any of theseconditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-tions to antimalarial drugs or related medicines in thepast should let his or her physician know before takingthe drugs again. The physician should also be toldabout any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, orother substances.
PREGNANCY. In laboratory animal studies, someantimalarial drugs cause birth defects. But it is alsorisky for a pregnant woman to get malaria. Untreatedmalaria can cause premature birth,stillbirth, and mis- carriage. When given in low doses to prevent malaria,antimalarial drugs have not been reported to cause birthdefects in humans. If possible, pregnant women shouldavoid traveling to areas where they could get malaria. Iftravel is necessary, women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physiciansabout the use of antimalarial drugs.
BREASTFEEDING. Some antimalarial drugs pass intobreast milk. Although no problems have been reported innursing babies whose mothers took antimalarial drugs,babies and young children are particularly sensitive tosome of these drugs. Women who are breastfeedingshould check with their physicians before using anti-malarial drugs.OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-malarial drugs, people who have any of these medicalproblems (or have had them in the past) should makesure their physicians are aware of their conditions:• blood disease• liver disease• nerve or brain disease or disorder, including seizures(convulsions)• past or current mental disorder• stomach or intestinal disease• deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehy-drogenase (G6PD), which is important in the break-down of sugar in the body• deficiency of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinu-cleotide (NADH) methemoglobin reductase• psoriasis• heart disease• family or personal history of the genetic condition fav-ism (a hereditary allergic condition)• family or personal history of hemolytic anemia, a con- dition in which red blood cells are destroyed• purpura• hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)• blackwater fever (a serious complication of one type ofmalaria)• myasthenia gravis (a disease of the nerves and muscles)
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antimalarialdrugs with certain other drugs may affect the way thedrugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
High doses of the antimalarial drug pyrimethaminemay cause blood problems that caninterfere with healingand increase the risk of infection. People taking this drugshould be careful not to injure their gums when brushingor flossing their teeth or using toothpicks. If possible,dental work should be postponed until treatment is com-plete and the blood has returned to normal.The most common side effects of antimalarial drugsare diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, stomach cramps orpain, loss of appetite,headache,itching, difficulty con-centrating, dizziness, lightheadedness, and sleep prob-lems. These problems usually go away as the bodyadjusts to the drug and do not require medical treatment.Less common side effects, such as hair loss or loss ofcolor in the hair; skin rash; or blue-black discoloration ofthe skin, fingernails, or inside of the mouth also may

Antimigraine drugs
Definition
Antimigraine drugs are medicines used to prevent orreduce the severity of migraine headaches.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 288Antimigraine drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 288Purpose
Migraine headaches usually cause a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting,dizziness, increased sensitivity to light and sound, and other symp-toms may accompany the pain. The attacks may last forseveral hours or for a day or more and may come as oftenas several times a week. Some people who get migraineheadaches have warning signals before the headachesbegin, such as restlessness, tingling in an arm or leg, orseeing patterns of flashing lights. This set of signals iscalled an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in thissection are meant to be taken as soon as the pain begins,to relieve the pain and other symptoms. Other types ofdrugs, such as antiseizure medicines, antidepressants,calcium channel blockersand beta blockers, are some-times prescribed to prevent attacks in people with verysevere or frequent migraines.
Description
Migraine is thought to be caused by electrical andchemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain. Theseimbalances affect the blood vessels in the brain—firsttightening them up, then widening them. As the blood ves-sels widen, they stimulate the release of chemicals thatincrease sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation andswelling. Antimigraine drugs are believed to work by cor-recting the imbalances and by tightening the blood vessels.Examples of drugs in this group are ergotamine(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex),rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methy-sergide maleate (Sansert) may be used by patients whoseheadaches are not controlled by other drugs, while somepatients do well on other drugs. For example, combina-tions or ergotamine and caffeinemay be very effective.The caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to relievethe headache. Sometimes, an analgesic such as aceta- minophen, caffeine, and a barbiturate which acts as asedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and similar com-pounds. These medicines are available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and come in several forms. Ergota-mine is available as tablets and rectal suppositories;sumatriptan as tablets, injections, and nasal spray; andzolmitriptan as tablets.Antimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches oncethey have started. These drugs should not be taken to pre-vent headaches.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of drug.Typical recommended dosages for adults are given belowfor each type of drug.ErgotamineTake at the first sign of a migraine attack. Patientswho get warning signals (aura) may take the drug as soonas they know a headache is coming.TABLETS. No more than six tablets for any singleattack.No more than 10 tablets per week.
SUPPOSITORIES. No more than two suppositoriesfor any single attack.No more than five suppositories per week.NaratriptanTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptomsbegin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as notall auras result in a migraine.
TABLETS. Usual dose is one 1-mg tablet taken withwater or other liquid.Doses of 2.5-mg may be used, but they may causemore side effects.If the headache returns or if there is only partialresponse, the dose may be repeated once after four hours,for a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period. Largerdoses do not seem to offer any benefit.SumatriptanTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptomsbegin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as notall auras result in a migraine.
TABLETS. Usual dose is one 25-mg tablet, taken withwater or other liquid.Doses should be spaced at least two hours apart.Anyone with liver disease should consult with aphysician for proper dosing.
INJECTIONS. No more than 6 mg per dose, injectedunder the skin.No more than two 6-mg injections per day. Thesedoses should be taken at least 1 hour apart.ZolmitriptanTake as soon as symptoms begin.
TABLETS. Usual dose is 1-5 mg. Additional dosesmay be taken at two-hour intervals.No more than 10 mg per 24-hour period.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 289Antimigraine drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 289General dosage adviceAlways take antimigraine drugs exactly as directed.Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not takethe drug for longer than directed.If possible, lie down and relax in a dark, quiet roomfor a few hours after taking the medicine.
Precautions
These drugs should be used only to treat the type ofheadache for which they were prescribed. Patients shouldnot use them for other headaches, such as those causedby stressor too much alcohol, unless directed to do so bya physician.Anyone whose headache is unlike any previousheadache should check with a physician before taking thesedrugs. If the headache is far worse than any other, emer-gency medical treatment should be sought immediately.Taking too much of the antimigraine drug ergota-mine (Cafergot), can lead to ergot poisoning. Symptomsinclude headache, muscle pain, numbness, coldness, andunusually pale fingers and toes. If not treated, the condi-tion can lead to gangrene(tissue death).Sumatriptan (Imitrex), naratriptan (Amerge), riza-triptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) may interactwith ergotamine. These drugs should not be taken within24 hours of taking any drug containing ergotamine.Some antimigraine drugs work by tightening bloodvessels in the brain. Because these drugs also affectblood vessels in other parts of the body, people withcoronary heart disease, circulatory problems, or highblood pressure should not take these medicines unlessdirected to do so by their physicians.Special conditionsPeople with certain other medical conditions or whoare taking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake antimigraine drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto ergotamine, caffeine, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, orother antimigraine drugs in the past should let his or herphysician know before taking the drugs again. The physi-cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant should nottake ergotamine (Cafergot). The effects of other antimi-graine drugs during pregnancyhave not been well stud-ied. Any woman who is pregnant or plans to becomepregnant should let her physician know before an antimi-graine drug is prescribed.
BREASTFEEDING. Some antimigraine drugs can passinto breast milk and may cause serious problems in nurs-ing babies. Women who are breastfeeding should checkwith their physicians about whether to stop breastfeedingwhile taking the medicine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before usingantimigraine drugs, people with any of these medicalproblems should make sure their physicians know abouttheir conditions:• coronary heart disease• angina (crushing chest pain)• circulatory problems or blood vessel disease• high blood pressure• liver problems• kidney problems• any infection• eye problems
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antimigrainedrugs certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.

Antimyocardial antibody test
Definition
Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done whenevaluating a person for heart damage or heart disease.
Purpose
Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies. Nor-mal antibodies are special proteins built by the body as adefense against foreign material entering the body.Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body, butinstead of attacking foreign material, they inappropriate-ly attack the body’s own cells. Antimyocardial antibodiesattack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium.This test may be done on a person who recently hadtrauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a myocardialinfarction (heart attack). It also may be done on some-one with heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy orrheumatic fever.Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodiesdoes not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is aconnection between the presence of these antibodies anddamage to the heart. The amount of damage, however,cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 291Antimyocardial antibody testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 291These antibodies usually appear after heart surgeryor the beginning of disease, but they may be presentbefore surgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of peoplewith myocardial infarction and 70% of people havingheart surgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear with-in two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks.
Description
A 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from thepatient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow. Antimyocar-dial antibodies are detected by combining a patient’sserum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood) with cells fromanimal heart tissue, usually that of a monkey. Antimyocar-dial antibodies in the serum bind to the heart tissue cells. Afluorescent dye is then added to the mixture. This dye willattach to any antibodies and heart tissue cells boundtogether. The final mixture is studied under a microscopethat is designed to show fluorescence. If fluorescent cellsare seen under the microscope, the test is positive.When the test is positive, the next step is to find outhow much antibody is present. The patient’s serum isdiluted, or titered, and the test is done again. The serum isthen further diluted and the test repeated until the serum isso dilute that fluorescence is no longer seen. The last dilu-tion that showed fluorescence is the titer reported.
Preparation
No fastingor special prepartion is needed. Beforethe test is done it should be explained to the patient.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite after the blood is drawn or the person may feel dizzyor faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleedingstops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the puncture siterelieve discomfort.
Normal results
Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen inhealthy individuals.
Abnormal results
A positive result means that antimyocardial antibod-ies are present and that heart disease or damage is likely.Further testing may be needed as other autoantibodiescould also be present, causing a false abnormal test.Resources

Antinausea drugs
Definition
Antinausea drugs are medicines that control nausea—a feeling of sickness or queasiness in the stomach with anurge to vomit. These drugs also prevent or stop vomiting.Drugs that control vomiting are called antiemetic drugs.
Purpose
The drug described here, prochlorperazine (Com-pazine), controls both nausea and vomiting. Prochlor-perazine is also sometimes prescribed for symptoms ofmental disorders, such as schizophrenia.
Description
Prochlorperazine is available only with a physician’sprescription. It is sold in syrup, capsule, tablet, injection,and suppository forms.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 292Antinausea drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 292Recommended dosage
To control nausea and vomiting in adults, the usualdose is:• tablets: one 5-mg or 10-mg tablet three to four times aday• extended-release capsules: one 15-mg capsule firstthing in the morning or one 10-mg capsule every 12hours• suppository: 25 mg, twice a day• syrup: 5-10 mg three to four times a day• injection: 5-10 mg injected into a muscle three to fourtimes a dayDoses for children must be determined by a physician.
Precautions
Prochlorperazine may cause a movement disordercalled tardive dyskinesia. Signs of this disorder areinvoluntary twitches and muscle spasms in the face andbody and jutting or rolling movements of the tongue. Thecondition may be permanent. Older people, especiallywomen, are particularly at risk of developing this prob-lem when they take prochlorperazine.Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, orless alert when using this medicine. The drug may alsocause blurred vision, and movement problems. Forthese reasons, anyone who takes this drug should notdrive, use machines or do anything else that might bedangerous until they have found out how the drugaffects them.Prochlorperazine makes some people sweat less,which can allow the body to overheat. The drug mayalso make the skin and eyes more sensitive to the sun.People who are taking prochlorperazine should try toavoid extreme heat and exposure to the sun. Whengoing outdoors, they should wear protective clothing, ahat, a sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) ofat least 15, and sunglasses that block ultraviolet (UV)light. Saunas, sunlamps, tanning booths, tanning beds,hot baths, and hot tubs should be avoided while takingthis medicine. Anyone who must be exposed to extremeheat while taking the drug should check with his or herphysician.This medicine adds to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as antihistamines, cold and flu medicines, tran-quilizers, sleep aids, anesthetics, some painmedicines,and muscle relaxants. Do not drink alcohol while tak-ing prochlorperazine, and check with the physician whoprescribed the drug before combining it with any othermedicines.Do not stop taking this medicine without checkingwith the physician who prescribed it. Stopping the drugsuddenly can dizziness, nausea, vomiting,tremors, and other side effects. When stopping the medicine, it may benecessary to taper down the dose gradually.Prochlorperazine may cause false pregnancytests.Women who are pregnant (or planning to becomepregnant) or breast feeding should check with theirphysicians before using this medicine.Before using prochlorperazine, people with any ofthese medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:• previous sensitivity or allergic reaction to prochlorper-azine• heart disease• glaucoma• brain tumor• intestinal blockage• abnormal blood conditions, such as leukemia• exposure to pesticides.
Side effects
Many side effects are possible with this drug,including, but not limited to,constipation, dizziness,drowsiness, decreased sweating,dry mouth, stuffy nose,movement problems, changes in menstrual period,increased sensitivity to sun, and swelling or pain inbreasts. Anyone who has unusual or troublesome symp-toms after taking prochlorperazine should get in touchwith his or her physician.

Antinuclear antibody test
Definition
The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test doneearly in the evaluation of a person for autoimmune orrheumatic disease, particularly systemic lupus erythe-matosus(SLE).
Purpose
In autoimmune diseases, the body makes antibodiesthat work against its own cells or tissues. Rheumatic dis-eases (diseases that affect connective tissue, includingthe joints, bone, and muscle) are also associated withKEY TERMS

Autoantibodies are proteins built by thebody, but instead of guarding against foreign material(including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as normal anti-bodies do, they attack the body’s own cells.Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficultto diagnose. People with the same disease can have verydifferent symptoms. A helpful strategy in the diagnosisof these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibodyin the person’s blood.The antinuclear antibody test looks for a group ofautoantibodies that attack substances found in the center(nucleus) of all cells. It is useful as a screen for manyautoantibodies associated with diseases that affect theentire body (systemic diseases).This test is particularly useful when diagnosing aperson with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affectsmany body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it isunlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,more tests are done to confirm whether the person hasSLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such asscleroderma,Sjögren’s syndrome,Raynaud’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis, oftenhave a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.
Description
Five to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. Theantinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’sserum to commercial cells mounted on a microscopeslide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they bindto the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second anti-body is added to the mixture. This antibody is “tagged”with a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen. The secondantibody attaches to any antibodies and cells boundtogether and, because of the fluorescent “tag,” the areaswith antinuclear antibodies seem to glow, or fluoresce,when the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope.If fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.When positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and thetest done again. These steps are repeated until the serumis so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The lastdilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported.The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives thephysician clues as to what the disease might be. The testresult includes the titer and the pattern.This test is also called the fluorescent antinuclearantibody test or FANA. Results are available within oneto three days.
Preparation
No special preparations or diet changes are requiredbefore a person undergoes an antinuclear antibody test.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 294Antinuclear antibody testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 294Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results will be negative, showing no antinu-clear antibodies.
Abnormal results
A positive test in a person with symptoms of anautoimmune or rheumatic disease helps the physicianmake a diagnosis. More than 95% of people with SLEhave a positive ANA test. Scleroderma has a 60-71%positive rate; Sjögren’s disease, 50-60%, and rheumatoidarthritis, 25-30%.Several factors must be considered when interpret-ing a positive test. Diseases other than autoimmune dis-eases can cause autoantibodies. Some healthy peoplehave a positive test. More testing is done after a positivetest to identify individual autoantibodies associated withthe various diseases.Resources

Antiparkinson drugs
Definition
Antiparkinson drugs are medicines that relieve thesymptoms of Parkinson’s diseaseand other forms ofparkinsonism.
Purpose
Antiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms ofparkinsonism, a group of disorders that share four mainsymptoms: tremor or trembling in the hands, arms, legs,jaw, and face; stiffness or rigidity of the arms, legs, andtrunk; slowness of movement (bradykinesia); and poorbalance and coordination. Parkinson’s disease is the mostcommon form of parkinsonism and is seen more fre-quently with advancing age. Other forms of the disordermay result from viral infections, environmental toxins,carbon monoxide poisoning, and the effects of treat-ment with antipsychotic drugs.The immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease orParkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotrans-mitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may take sev-eral forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibitionof dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of thedopamine already present, or sensitization of dopaminereceptors. Drugs may be used singly or in combination.
Description
Levodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of Parkinson’streatment. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, and isconverted to dopamine. The drug may be administeredalone, or in combination with carbidopa (Lodosyn) which
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 295Antiparkinson drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 295inhibits the enzyme responsible for the destruction of lev-odopa. The limitation of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopatherapy is that after approximately two years of treatment,the drugs cease to work reliably. This has been termed the“on-off phenomenon.” Additional treatment strategieshave been developed to retard the progression of Parkin-sonism, or to find alternative approaches to treatment.Anticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptomsof Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of dopamine,thereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohor-mone. They may be effective in all stages of the disease.All drugs with anticholinergic properties, the naturallyoccurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine,hyoscyamine), some antihistamineswith anticholinergicproperties, and synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin),procyclidine (Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) aremembers of this group. Although the anticholinergicdrugs have only limited activity against Parkinson’s dis-ease, they are useful in the early stages, and may beadjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses.Amantadine (Symmetrel), was developed for pre-vention of influenzavirus infection, but has anti-Parkin-sonian properties. Its mechanism of action is not known.Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor,which is used for a variety of indications includingamenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility, and acromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation ofthe dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a lateadjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction inlevodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar tobromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively inParkinson’s disease.Entacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaininglevels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is usedas an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning toexperience the on-off effect. Tolcapone (Tasmar) is asimilar agent, but has demonstrated the potential forinducing severe liver failure. As such, tolcapone isreserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapieshave failed or are contraindicated.Selegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selectivemonoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however itsmechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear, sinceother drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed to showsimilar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is used pri-marily as an adjunct to levodopa, although some studieshave indicated that the drug may be useful in the earlystages of Parkinsonism, and may delay the progressionof the disease.Pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip) arebelieved to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine recep-tors in the brain. They may be used alone in early Parkison’sdisease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages.
Recommended dosage
Dosages of anti-Parkinsonian medications must behighly individualized. All doses must be carefully titrat-ed. Consult specific references.
Precautions
There are a large number of drugs and drug classesused to treat Parkinson’s disease, and individual refer-ences should be consulted.The anticholinergics have a large number of adverseeffects, all related to their primary mode of activity. Theircardiovascular effects include tachycardia,palpitations, hypotension, postural hypotension, and mild bradycar-dia. They may also cause a wide range of central nervoussystem effects, including disorientation, confusion,memory loss,hallucinations, psychoses, agitation, ner-vousness,delusions,delirium,paranoia, euphoria,excitement, lightheadedness,dizziness,headache, list- lessness, depression, drowsiness, weakness, and giddi-ness. Dry mouth, dry eyes and gastrointestinal distressare common problems. Sedationhas been reported withsome drugs in this group, but this may be beneficial inpatients who suffer from insomnia.

Because these drugs inhibit prolactin secre-tion, they should not be taken while breastfeeding.
Side effects
The most common side effects are associated withthe central nervous system, and include dizziness, light-headedness, mood changes and hallucinations. Gastroin-testinal problems, including nausea and vomiting, arealso common.
Interactions

Antiprotozoal drugs
Definition
Antiprotozoal drugs are medicines that treat infec-tions caused by protozoa.
Purpose
Antiprotozoal drugs are used to treat a variety of dis-eases caused by protozoa. Protozoa are animal-like, one-celled animals, such as amoebas. Some are parasites thatcause infections in the body. African sleeping sickness, giardiasis,amebiasis,Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia(PCP), and malariaare examples of diseases caused byprotozoa.
Description
Antiprotozoal drugs come in liquid, tablet, andinjectable forms and are available only with a doctor’sprescription. Some commonly used antiprotozoal drugsare metronidazole (Flagyl), eflornithine (Ornidyl), fura-zolidone (Furoxone), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil),iodoquinol (Diquinol, Yodoquinol, Yodoxin), and pen-tamidine (Pentam 300).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofantiprotozoal drug, its strength, and the medical problemfor which it is being used. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage. Always take antiproto-zoal drugs exactly as directed.Precautions
Some people feel dizzy, confused, lightheaded, orless alert when using these drugs. The drugs may alsocause blurred vision and other vision problems. For thesereasons, anyone who takes these drugs should not drive,use machines or do anything else that might be danger-ous until they have found out how the drugs affect them.The antiprotozoal drug furazolidone may cause verydangerous side effects when taken with certain foods orbeverages. Likewise, metronidazole (Flagyl) can causeserious liver damage if taken with alcohol. Check withthe physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription for a list of products to avoidwhile taking these medicines.Anyone who has ever had unusual reactions toantiprotozoal drugs or related medicines should let his orher physician know before taking the drugs again. Thephysician should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.Some antiprotozoal drugs may cause problems withthe blood. This can increase the risk of infection orexcessive bleeding. Patients taking these drugs shouldbecareful not to injure their gums when brushing or floss-ing their teeth or using a toothpick. They shouldcheckwith the physician before having any dentalwork done.Care should also be taken to avoidcuts from razors, nailclippers, or kitchen knives, orhousehold tools. Anyonewho has any of these symptoms while taking antiproto-zoal drugs should call the physician immediately:• fever or chills• signs of cold or flu• signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or inflam-mation• unusual bruising or bleeding• black, tarry stools• blood in urine or stools• pinpoint red spots on the skin• unusual tiredness or weakness.Anyone taking this medicine should also check witha physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur:• blurred vision or other vision changes• skin rash,hives, or itching• swelling of the neck• clumsiness or unsteadiness• numbness, tingling,pain, or weakness in the hands orfeet• decrease in urination

Antipsychotic drugs
Definition
Antipsychotic drugs are a class of medicines used totreat psychosisand other mental and emotional condi-tions.
Purpose
Psychosis is defined as “a serious mental disorder(as schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lostcontact with reality often with hallucinationsor delu- sions.” Psychosis is an end-stage condition arising from avariety of possible causes. Anti-psychotic drugs controlthe symptoms of psychosis, and in many cases are effec-tive in controlling the symptoms of other disorders thatmay lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder(formerly termed manic-depressive), in which the patientcycles from severe depression to feelings of extremeexcitation. This class of drugs is primarily composed ofthe major tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, adrug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, iscommonly classified among the antipsychotic agents.
Description
The antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi-cal class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group, andinclude chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine (Ser-entil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine(Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in actionand adverse effects. They may also be used as anti-emet-ics, although prochlorperazine is the drug most oftenused for this indication.The phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol (Haldol)and pimozide (Orap). They find primary use in control ofTourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol has been extremelyuseful in controlling aggressive behavior.The debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril),loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiap-ine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psy-chotic symptoms that have not been responsive to otherclasses of drugs.The benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone(Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone hasbeen found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorder,while ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treat-ment for schizophrenia.In addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychoticagents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Lithonate),which is used for control of bipolar mood disorder, andthiothixene (Navane), which is used in the treatment ofpsychosis.
Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the drug, condition being treated,and patient response. See specific references.
Precautions
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is arare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal symp-toms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance.Onset may be hours to months after drug initiation, butonce started, proceeds rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. It ismost commonly associated with haloperidol, long-actingfluphenazine, but has occurred with thiothixene, thiori-dazine, and clozapine, and may occur with other agents.NMS is potentially fatal, and requires intensive sympto-matic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neu-roleptic treatment. There is no established treatment.Most patients who develop NMS will have the sameproblem if the drug is restarted.Tardive dyskinesia(TD). Tardive dyskinesia is asyndrome of involuntary movements that may appear inpatients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Although preva-lence of TD appears highest among the elderly, especial-ly women, it is impossible to predict which patients arelikely to develop the syndrome. Both the risk of develop-ing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversibleare increased with higher doses and longer periods oftreatment. The syndrome can develop after short treat-ment periods at low doses. Anticholinergic agents mayworsen these effects. Clozapine has occasionally beenuseful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychot-ic drugs.Agranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine.This is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be preventedwith careful monitoring of the white blood count. There are no well-established risk factors for developing agran-ulocytosis, and so all patients treated with this drug mustfollow the clozapine Patient Management System. Formore information, call 1-800-448-5938.Anticholinergic effects, particularly dry mouth, have been reported with all of the phenothiazines, andcan be severe enough to cause patients to discontinuetheir medication.Photosensitization is a common reaction to chlor-promazine. Patients must be instructed to use precautionswhen exposed to sunlight.

The drugs in this class appearto be generally safe for occasional use at low doses dur-ing pregnancy, but should be avoided near time of deliv-ery. Although the drugs do not appear to be teratogenic,when used near term, they may cross the placenta andhave adverse effects on the newborn infant, includingcausing involuntary movements. There is no informationabout safety in breast feeding.As a class, the antipsychotic drugs have a large num-ber of potential side effects, many of them serious. Spe-cific references should be consulted.
Interactions
Because the phenothiazines have anticholinergiceffects, they should not be used in combination withother drugs that may have similar effects.Because the drugs in this group may cause hypoten- sion, or low blood pressure, they should be used withextreme care in combination with blood pressure-lower-ing drugs.The antipsychotic drugs have a large number of druginteractions. Consult specific references.Samuel D. Uretsky, PharmD
Antipsychotic drugs, atypical
Definition
The atypical antipsychotic agents, sometimes calledthe “novel” antipsychotic agents are a group of drugswhich are different chemically from the older drugs usedto treat psychosis. The “conventional”antipsychoticdrugsare classified by their chemical structures as thephenothiazines, thioxanthines (which are chemicallyvery similar to the phenothiazines), butyrophenones,diphenylbutylpiperadines and the indolones. All of theatypical antipsychotic agents are chemically classified asdibenzepines. They are considered atypicalor novel because they have different side effects from the conven-tional antipsychotic agents. The atypical drugs are farless likely to cause extra-pyrammidal side-effects(EPS),drug induced involuntary movements, than are the olderdrugs. The atypical antipsychotic drugs may also beeffective in some cases that are resistant to older drugs.The drugs in this group are clozapine (Clozaril),loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiap-ine (Seroquel).
Purpose
The antipsychotic drugs are used to treat severeemotional disorders. Although there may be differentnames for these disorders, depending on severity andhow long the symptoms last, psychotic disorders allcause at least one of the following symptoms:• delusions•hallucinations• disorganized speech• grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviorLoxapine has also been used to treat anxietywith mental depression.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dose depends on the drug, thepatient, and the condition being treated. The normalpractice is to start each patient at a low dose, and gradu-ally increase the dose until a satisfactory response isachieved. The odse should be held at the lowest level thatgives satisfactory results.

Doses higher than 900 mill-grams/day are not recommended.Loxapine is usually effective at doses of 60-100 mil-ligrams/day, but may be used in doses as high as 250mg/day if needed.Olanzapine doses vary with the condition beingtreated. The usual maximum dose is 20 milligrams/day.Quetiapine may be dosed anywhere from 150-750 mil-ligrams/day, depending on how well the patient responds.
Precautions
Although the atypical antipsychotics are generallysafe, clozapine has been associated with severe agranulo-cytosis, a shortage of white blood cells. For this reason,people who may be treated with clozapine should haveblood counts before starting the drug, blood counts everyweek for as long as they are using clozapine, and bloodcounts every week for the first four weeks after they stoptaking clozapine. If there is any evidence of a drop in thewhite blood countwhile using clozapine, the drugshould be stopped.Atypical antipsychotics should not be used inpatients with liver damage, brain or circulatory prob-lems, or some types of blood problems.AllergiesPeople who have had an allergic reaction to one ofthe atypical antipsychotics should not use that medica-tion again. However, sometimes it is possible to use adifferent drug from the same group safely.PregnancyThe atypical antipsychotics have not been provedsafe in pregnancy. They should be used only whenclearly needed and when potential benefits outweighpotential hazards to the fetus. These drugs have not beenreported in human milk.
Side effects
Although the atypical antipsychotics are less likely tocause involuntary movements than the older antipsychoticdrugs, they still have a large number of adverse effects.The following list is not complete. Review each drug indi-vidually for a full list of possible adverse effects.• chest pain• high blood pressure• low blood pressure• fast heart beatKEY TERMS
Anxiety—An abnormal and overwhelming senseof apprehension and fear often marked by physio-logical signs (as sweating, tension, and increasedpulse), by doubt concerning the reality and natureof the threat, and by self-doubt about one’s capac-ity to cope with it.Delusions—A false belief regarding the self or per-sons or objects outside the self that persists despitethe facts.Depression—A state of being depressed markedespecially by sadness, inactivity, difficulty withthinking and concentration, a significant increase ordecrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feel-ings of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimessuicidal thoughts or an attempt to commit suicide.Glucocorticoid—Any of a group of corticosteroids(as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone) that areanti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive, andthat are used widely in medicine (as in the allevia-tion of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis).Psychosis—A serious mental disorder character-ized by defective or lost contact with reality oftenwith hallucinations or delusions.• aggitation• memory loss• confusion• dizziness• tiredness• headache• sleep disturbances• stuttering• dry skin• nausea• constipation•f e v e r• weight gain• visual disturbances
Interactions
Taking atypical antipsychotic medications with cer-tain other drugs may affect the way the drugs work ormay increase the chance of side effects. While takingantipsychotic drugs, do not take any other prescription or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 302Antipsychotic drugs, atypicalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 302nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs without firstchecking with a physician.Because the atypical antipsychotics may cause low-ering of blood pressure, care should be used when thesedrugs are taken at the same time as other drugs whichlower blood pressure.Quetiapine has many interactions. Doses should becarefully adjusted when quetiapine is used with keto-conazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, car-bamazepine,barbiturates, rifampin or glucocorticoidsincluding prednisone, dexamethasone and methylpred-nisolone.These drugs will also require dose adjustments whenused with antiparkinson drugs.Resources

Antiretroviral drugs
Definition
Antiretroviral drugs inhibit the reproduction ofretroviruses—viruses composed of RNA rather thanDNA. The best known of this group is HIV , humanimmunodeficiencyvirus, the causative agent of AIDS.
Purpose
Antiretroviral agents are virustatic agents whichblock steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs arenot curative; however continued use of drugs, particular-ly in multi-drug regimens, significantly slows diseaseprogression.
Description
There are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,although only two steps in the viral replications processare blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine (ddI,Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine (d4T, Zerit),zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir),act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase.Because a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus mustmake a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reversetranscriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making theDNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is afaulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing.The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-hibitors(NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor),loviride, and nevirapine (Viramune) act by bindingdirectly to the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibitingits activity.Protease inhibitors, such as indinavir (Crixivan),nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir(Invirase) act on the enzyme protease, which is essentialfor the virus to break down the proteins in infected cells.Without this essential step, the virus produces immaturecopies of itself, which are non-infectious.Because HIV mutates readily, the virus can developresistance to single drug therapy. However, treatmentwith drug combinations appears to produce a durableresponse. Proper treatment appears to slow the progres-sion of HIV infections and reduce the frequency ofopportunistic infections.
Recommended dosage
Doses must be individualized based on the patient,and use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinationsof antiretroviral drugs have not been determined, nor isthere agreement on the stage of infection at which to starttreatment.
Precautions
Although the antiretroviral drugs fall into threegroups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effectsand drug interactions. Since the drugs are used in variouscombinations, the frequency and severity of adverseeffects will vary with the combination. Although mostdrug combinations show a higher rate of adverse eventsthat single drug therapy, some patterns are not pre-dictable. For example, indinavir has been reported tocause insomniain 3% of patients, however, when usedin combination with zidovudine, only 1.5% of patientscomplained of sleep difficulties.The most severe adverse effects associated with theprotease inhibitors are renal and hepatic toxicity. Patientshave also reported a syndrome of abdominal distention
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 303Antiretroviral drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 303and increased body odor, which may be socially limiting.Hemophilic patients have reported increased bleedingtendencies while taking protease inhibitors. The drugsare pregnancycategory B. There have been no con-trolled studies of safety in pregnancy. HIV-infectedmothers are advised not to breast feed in order to preventtransmission of the virus to the newborn.The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors havesignificant levels of toxicity. Lactic acidosis in theabsence of hypoxemia and severe hepatomegaly withsteatosis have been reported with zidovudine and zal-citabine, and are potentially fatal. Rare cases of hepaticfailure, considered possibly related to underlying hepati- tis Band zalcitabine monotherapy, have been reported.Abacavir has been associated with fatal hypersensi-tivity reactions. Didanosine has been associated withsevere pancreatitis. Nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors are pregnancy category C. There is limitedinformation regarding safety during pregnancy. Zidovu-dine has been used during pregnancy to reduce the risk ofHIV infection to the infant. HIV-infected mothers areadvised not to breastfeed in order to prevent transmissionof the virus to the newborn.Efavirenz has been associated with a high frequencyof skin rash, 27% in adults and 40% in children. Nevirap-ine has been associated with severe liver damage andskin reactions. All of the non-nucleoside reverse tran-scriptase inhibitors are pregnancy category C, based onanimal studies.KEY TERMS
Antiviral drugs—Medicines that cure or controlvirus infections.Bioavailability—A measure of the amount of drugthat is actually absorbed from a given dose.Immune system—The body’s natural defensesagainst disease and infection.Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heatthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.Insomnia—A sleep disorder characterized byinability to either fall asleep or to stay asleep.Mutates—Undergoes a spontaneous change in themake-up of genes or chromosomes.Pancreas—A gland located beneath the stomach.The pancreas produces juices that help break downfood and secretes insulin that helps the body usesugar for energy.Pregnancy category—A system of classifying drugsaccording to their established risks for use duringpregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studieshave demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B: Animalstudies indicate no fetal risk, but no human studies;or adverse effects in animals, but not in well-con-trolled human studies. Category C: No adequatehuman or animal studies; or adverse fetal effects inanimal studies, but no available human data. Cate-gory D: Evidence of fetal risk, but benefits outweighrisks. Category X: Evidence of fetal risk. Risks out-weigh any benefits.Retrovirus—A virus composed of ribonucleic acid(RNA) instead of deoxynucleic acid (DNA).Virus—A tiny, disease-causing particle that canreproduce only in living cells.Because of the high risk of viral resistance develop-ment, antiretroviral agents should be used in combina-tion. If one drug in the group must be discontinued, it isrecommended that all antiretroviral therapy be discontin-ued until a multi-drug regimen can be resumed. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors particularlyshould not be used alone.
Interactions
Because of the high frequency of drug interactionsassociated with AIDS therapy, specialized referencesshould be consulted.Saquinavir is marketed in both hard and soft gelatincapsules. Because saquinavir in the hard gelatin capsuleformulation (Invirase) has poor bioavailability, it is rec-ommended that this formulation only be used in combi-nation with other drugs which interact to raise saquinavirblood levels. Saquinavir soft gelatin capsules (Fortovase)are the preferred dosage form of this drug.Resources

Antirheumatic drugs
Definition
Antirheumatic drugs are drugs used to treat rheuma- toid arthritis.
Purpose
Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive form of arthritisthat has devastating effects on joints and general health. Itis classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis-ease is caused by the body’s own immune system actingagainst the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff,swollen joints,fever,fatigue, and loss of appetite.In recent years, there has been a change in attitudeconcerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi-cians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs(DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and areless inclined to wait for crippling stages before resortingto the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of theside-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types ofantirheumatic drugs.
Description
The major classes of antirheumatic drugs include:• Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs.Drugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic reliefof both inflammation and pain, but have a limited effecton the progressive bone and cartilage loss associatedwith rheumatoid arthritis. They act by slowing thebody’s production of prostaglandins. Common NSAIDsinclude: ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin or Advil), naproxen(Naprosyn, Aleve) and indomethacin(Indocin).•Corticosteroids. These drugs are very powerful anti-inflammatory agents. They are the synthetic analogs ofcortisone, produced by the body. Corticosteroids areused to reduce inflammation and suppress activity ofthe immune system. The most commonly prescribedare prednisone and dexamethasone.• Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).DMARDs influence the disease process itself and do notonly treat symptoms, hence their name. DMARDs alsohave anti-inflammatory effects, and most were borrowedfrom the treatment of other diseases, such as cancerand malaria. Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine(Aralen) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). PowerfulDMARDs include: methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sul-fasalazine, cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran) andcyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine, sulfasalazine,penicillamine, and organic gold compounds such asaurothioglucose (Solganol), gold sodium thiomalate(Aurolate) and auranofin (Ridaura).• Slow-Acting Antirheumatic Drugs (SAARDs). SAARDsare a special class of DMARDs and the effect of thesedrugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as thatof the NSAIDs. Examples are hydroxychloroquine andaurothioglucose.• Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs. This class of drugsis used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs haveno effect. Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizingeffect on the immune system. Since the inflammationassociated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctionsof the immune system, use of this class of drugs hasbeen shown to be beneficial for the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis as well. Examples are: methotrex-ate, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambu-cil, and azathioprine.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of drug.The prescribing physician or the pharmacist provideinformation for the correct dosage. The drugs must betaken exactly as directed.When taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis,it should be taken only once or twice a week as pre-scribed,not every day. Taking it every day can lead to afatal overdose.
Precautions
Many antirheumatic drugs such as, for example, aza-thioprine (Imuran) and methotrexate (Rheumatrex), are very
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 305Antirheumatic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 305powerful drugs. They are usually prescribed in severe cases,when all other treatments have failed. Thus, they may haveserious side effects, so it is important to be monitored close-ly by a physician while taking any of these drugs.
Side effects
Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may cause visionproblems. Anyone taking it should see an ophthalmolo-gist (a physician who specializes in treating eyes) for athorough eye examinationevery six months.Methotrexate and penicillamine may cause birth defects. Women taking these drugs must stop takingthem during pregnancyand for several months before aplanned pregnancy. Methotrexate may also cause lungdamage or fertility problems and should not be taken byKEY TERMS

Anyonewho uses this drug and is sexually active should consultwith a physician about an effective birth control method.Other common side effects of antirheumatic drugsinclude abdominal cramps,diarrhea,dizziness, loss of appetite,headache, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills,and mouth sores. A variety of other side effects mayoccur. Anyone who has unusual symptoms while takingantirheumatic drugs should notify the treating physician.The gold compounds may cause serious blood prob-lems by reducing the ability of the blood forming organs toproduce blood cells.

Patients tak-ing these drugs should have regular blood counts.Entanercept (Enbrel) may also cause blood prob-lems, and some patients who received this drug havedeveloped eye problems and multiple sclerosis. It is not certain whether these reactions were caused by entaner-cept, but multiple sclerosis has been seen in patients tak-ing other drugs which act against tumor necrosis factor.
Interactions
Antirheumatic drugs may interact with a variety ofother medicines or other antirheumatic drugs. When thishappens, the effects of one or both of the drugs maychange, or the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyonewho takes this type of drug should inform the prescribingphysician about any other medication he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with antirheumaticdrugs are phenytoin (Dilantin),aspirin, sulfa drugs suchas Bactrim and Gantrisin, tetracycline and some otherantibioticsand cimetidine (Tagamet). NSAIDs such asibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are also known to interact withother classes of antirheumatic drugs.Resources

Antiseptics
Definition
An antiseptic is a substance which inhibits thegrowth and development of microorganisms. For practi-cal purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topi-cal agents, for application to skin, mucous membranes,and inanimate objects, although a formal definitionincludes agents which are used internally, such as the uri-nary tract antiseptics.
Purpose
Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which areapplied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for theiranti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal orbacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing of skin andwound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfacesprior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disin-fection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oralhygiene. Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani-mate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces.Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning includebenzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine,iodine compounds, mercury compounds, alcohol andhydrogen peroxide. Other agents which have been usedfor this purpose, but have largely been supplanted bymore effective or safer agents, include boric acid andvolatile oils such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen.)Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety whenapplied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oralrinses and preoperative total body washes.Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are usedprimarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium mayalso find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments,and in low concentration as a preservative for drugs includ-ing ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inacti-vated by organic compounds, including soap, and must notbe applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed.Iodine compounds include tincture of iodine andpovidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have thebroadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with actionagainst bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa, andyeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its alcoholiccomponent is drying and extremely irritating when appliedto abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin. Povidone iodine, anorganic compound, is less irritating and less toxic, but notas effective. Povidone iodine has been used for handscrubs and disinfection of surgical sites. Aqueous solu-tions of iodine have also been used as antiseptic agents,but are less effective than alcoholic solutions and less con-venient to use that the povidone iodine compounds.Hydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation ofoxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydro-gen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygenbubbles produces an effervescent action, which may beuseful for wound cleansing through removal of tissuedebris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may bereduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropri-ate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic useis 3%, although higher concentrations are available.Thimerosol (Mersol) is a mercury compound withactivity against bacteria and yeasts. Prolonged use mayresult in mercury toxicity.

Antispasmodic drugs
Definition
Antispasmodic drugs relieve cramps or spasms ofthe stomach, intestines, and bladder.KEY TERMS
Antibiotic—A medicine used to treat infections.Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that causemany diseases and infections.Mucous membrane—The moist lining of a bodycavity or structure, such as the mouth or nose.Residue—Traces that remain after most of the restof the material is gone.Purpose
Antispasmodic drugs have been used to treat stom-ach cramps. Traditionally, they were used to treat stom-ach ulcers, but for this purpose they have largely beenreplaced by the acid inhibiting compoundsa, the H-2receptor blockers such as cimetidine and ranitidine andthe proton pump inhibtors such as omeprazole, lansopra-zole and rabetazole.Most of the drugs used for this purpose as “anti-cholinergics”, since they counteract the effects of theneurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs arederived from the plant belladonna, also known as DeadlyNightshade. There is also a group of drugs with similaractivity, but not taken from plant sources. The anti-cholingergics decrease both the movements of the stom-ach and intestine, and also the secretions of stomach acidand digestive enzymes. They may be used for other pur-poses including treatment of Parkinson’s Disease, and bladder urgency. Because these drugs inhibit secretions,they cause dry mouthand dry eyes because of reducedsalivation and tearing. Dicyclomine is an antispasmodicwith very lettle effect on secretions. It is used to treatirritable bowel syndrome.
Description
Dicyclomine is available only with a prescriptionand is sold as capsules, tablets (regular and extended-release forms), and syrup.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults is 20 mg, four times aday. However, the physician may recommend starting ata lower dosage and gradually increasing the dose toreduce the chance of unwanted side effects.The dosage for children depends on the child’s age.Check with the child’s physician for the correct dosage.
Precautions
Dicyclomine makes some people sweat less, whichallows the body to overheat and may lead to heat prostra-tion (feverand heat stroke). Anyone taking this drugshould try to avoid extreme heat. If that is not possible,check with the physician who prescribed the drug. If heatprostration occurs, stop taking the medicine and call aphysician immediately.This medicine can cause drowsiness and blurred ordouble vision. People who take this drug should notdrive, use machines, or do anything else that might bedangerous until they have found out how the medicineaffects them.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 308Antispasmodic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 308Dicyclomine should not be given to infants or chil-dren unless the physician decides the use of this drug isnecessary. Diclyclomine should not be used by womenwho are breast feeding. Women who are pregnant or planto become pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using this drug.Anyone with the following medical conditionsshould not take dicyclomine unless directed to do so by aphysician:• previous sensitivity or allergic reaction to dicyclomine• glaucoma• myasthenia gravis• blockage of the urinary tract, stomach, or intestines• severe ulcerative colitis• reflux esophagitisIn addition, patients with these conditions shouldcheck with their physicians before using dicyclomine:• liver disease• kidney disease• high blood pressure• heart problems• enlarged prostate gland• hiatal hernia• autonomic neuropathy (a nerve disorder)• hyperthyroidism
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsi- ness, lightheadedness, nausea, nervousness, blurredvision, dry mouth, and weakness. Other side effects mayoccur. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after takingdicyclomine should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Dicyclomine may interact with other medicines.When this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Among the drugs that may interact with Dicy-clomine are:• antacids such as Maalox• antihistamines such as clemastine fumarate (Tavist)• bronchodilators (airway opening drugs) such as albu-terol (Proventil, Ventolin)• corticosteroids such as prednisone (Deltasone)• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) suchas phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate)• tranquilizers such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazo-lam (Xanax)KEY TERMS
Heat stroke—A serious condition that results fromexposure to extreme heat. The body loses its abili-ty to cool itself. Severe headache, high fever, andhot, dry skin may result. In severe cases, a personwith heat stroke may collapse or go into a coma.Hiatal hernia—A condition in which part of thestomach protrudes through the diaphragm.Hyperthyroidism—Secretion of excess thyroidhormones by the thyroid gland.Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heatthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.Myasthenia gravis—A condition in which certainmuscles weaken and may become paralyzed.Reflux esophagitis—Inflammation of the loweresophagus caused by the backflow of stomachcontents.Spasm—Sudden, involuntary tensing of a muscleor a group of musclesUlcerative colitis—Long-lasting and repeatedinflammation of the colon with the developmentof sores.The list above does not include every drug that mayinteract with dicyclomine. Be sure to check with a physi-cian or pharmacist before combining dicyclomine withany other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.Nancy Ross-Flanigan

Antituberculosis drugs
Definition
Antituberculosis drugs are medicines used to treattuberculosis, an infectious disease that can affect thelungs and other organs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 309Antituberculosis drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 309Purpose
Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacteriumtuberculae, a bacteria that is passed between peoplethrough the air. The disease can be cured with properdrug therapy, but because the bacteria may become resis-tant to any single drug, combinations of antituberculosisdrugs are used to treat tuberculosis (TB) are normallyrequired for effective treatment. At the start of the 20thCentury, tuberculosis was the most common cause ofdeathin the United States, but was laregly eliminatedwith better living conditions. It is most common in areasof crowding and poor ventilation, suich as crowdedurban areas and prisons. In some areas, the AIDSepi- demic has been accompanied by an increase in the preva-lence of tuberculosis.Some antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat orprevent other infections such as Mycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC), which causes disease throughout thebodies of people with AIDS or other diseases of theimmune system.
Description
Antituberculosis drugs are available only with aphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liq-uid and injectable forms. Some commonly used antitu-berculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin), ethambu-tol (Myambutol), ethionamide (Trecator-SC), isoniazid(Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide, rifabutin(Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofantituberculosis drug and may be different for differentpatients. Check with the physician who prescribed themedicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescriptionfor the proper dosage. The physician may graduallyincrease the dosage during treatment. Be sure to followthe physician’s orders. Patients who are infected withHIV must usually take larger combinations of drugs for alonger period of time than is needed for patients with anunimpaired immune system.Some antituberculosis drugs must be taken withother drugs. If they are taken alone, they may encouragethe bacteria that cause tuberculosis to become resistant todrugs used to treat the disease. When the bacteria becomeresistant, treating the disease becomes more difficult.To clear up tuberculosis completely, antituberculosisdrugs must be taken for as long as directed. This maymean taking the medicine every day for a year or two oreven longer. Symptoms may improve very quickly aftertreatment with this medicine begins. However, they maycome back if the medicine is stopped too quickly. Do notstop taking the medicine just because symptoms improve.Because people may neglect to take their medicationfor tuberculosis, it is common to have tuberculosis centersdevelop a program of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT.)In these programs, patients come to the hospital or clinic,and take their medication in front of an observer. Theseprograms may be annoying to the patients, but are justi-fied by the risks to public health if tuberculosis germswhich have become resistant to drugs were to be spread.Cycloserine works best when it is at constant levelsin the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the medi-cine in doses spaced evenly through the day and night.Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine at night inter-feres with sleep, or if it is difficult to remember to takethe medicine during the day, check with a health careprofessional for suggestions.Do not take antacidsthat contain aluminum, such asMaalox, within 1 hour of taking isoniazid, as this maykeep the medicine from working.Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking antituber-culosis drugs is important. The physician will check tomake sure the medicine is working as it should and willwatch for unwanted side effects. These visits also willhelp the physician know if the dosage needs to bechanged.Symptoms should begin to improve within a fewweeks after treatment begins with antituberculosis drugs.If they do not, or if they become worse, check with aphysician.Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, or lessalert when using these drugs. Some may also causevision changes, clumsiness, or unsteadiness. Because ofthese possible problems, anyone who takes antitubercu-losis drugs should not drive, use machines, or do any-thing else that might be dangerous until they have foundout how the medicine affects them.Daily doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B
6) may lessenor prevent some side effects of ethionamide or isoniazid.If the physician who prescribed the medicine recom-mends this, be sure to take the pyridoxine every day.Certain kinds of cheese (such as Swiss and Cheshire)and fish (such as tuna and skipjack) may cause an unusualreaction in people taking isoniazid. Symptoms of thisreaction include fast or pounding heartbeat, sweating or ahot feeling, chills or a clammy feeling,headache, light- headedness, and red or itchy skin. This reaction is very
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 310Antituberculosis drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 310rare. However, if any of these symptoms occur, checkwith a physician as soon as possible.Rifabutin and rifampin will make saliva, sweat, tears,urine, feces, and skin turn reddish orange to reddish brown.This is nothing to worry about. However, the discoloredtears may permanently stain soft contact lenses (but nothard contact lenses). To avoid ruining contact lenses, do notwear soft contacts while taking these medicines.Rifampin may temporarily lower the number ofwhite blood cells. Because the white blood cells areimportant in fighting infection, this effect increases thechance of getting an infection. This drug also may lowerthe number of platelets that play an important role inclotting. To reduce the risk of bleeding and infection inthe mouth while taking this medicine, be especially care-ful when brushing and flossing the teeth. Check with aphysician or dentist for suggestions on how to keep theteeth and mouth clean without causing injuries. Put offany dental work until blood counts return to normal.Rifampin may affect the results of some medical tests.Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicineshould alert the health care professional in charge.People who have certain medical conditions mayhave problems if they take antituberculosis drugs. Forexample:• cycloserine or isoniazid may increase the risk ofseizures (convulsions) in people with a history ofseizures.• the dosage of cycloserine may need to be adjusted forpeople with kidney disease.• ethambutol or pyrazinamide may cause or worsenattacks of goutin people who are prone to having them.• ethambutol may cause or worsen eye damage.• diabetes may be harder to control in patients who takeethionamide.• isoniazid may cause false results on some urine sugartests, and pyrazinamide may cause false results on urineketone tests. Diabetic patients who either of these medi-cines should discuss the possibility of false test resultswith their physicians.• people with liver disease or a history of alcohol abusemay be more likely to develop hepatitis when takingisoniazid and are more likely to have side effects thataffect the liver when taking rifampin.• in people with kidney disease, ethambutol, ethion-amide, or isoniazid may be more likely to cause sideeffects.• side effects are also more likely in people with liver dis-ease who take pyrazinamide.Before taking antituberculosis drugs, be sure to letthe physician know about these or any other medicalproblems.In laboratory tests of pregnant animals, high doses ofsome antituberculosis drugs have caused birth defectsand other problems in the fetus or newborn. However,pregnant women with tuberculosis need to take antituber-culosis drugs to clear up their disease. Knowing that manywomen have had healthy babies after taking these drugsduring pregnancymay be reassuring. Pregnant womenwho need to take this medicine and are worried about birthdefects or other problems should talk to their physicians.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antituber-culosis drugs or to niacin should let his or her physicianknow before taking any antituberculosis drug. The physi-cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.Patients who are on special diets, such as low-sodi-um or low-sugar diets, should make sure their physiciansknow. Some antituberculosis medicines may containsodium, sugar, or alcohol.
Side effects
CycloserineIn some people, this medicine causes depression andthoughts of suicide. If this happens, check with a physi-cian immediately. Switching to another medicine willusually stop these troubling thoughts and feelings. Alsolet the physician know immediately about any other moodor mental changes; such as nervousness, nightmares, anx- iety, confusion, or irritability; and about symptoms suchas muscle twitches, convulsions, or speech problems.Headache is a common side effect that usually goesaway as the body adjusts to this medicine. This problemdoes not need medical attention unless it continues or itinterferes with everyday life.EthambutolThis medicine may cause eye painor vision changes, including loss of vision or changes in colorvision. Check with a physician immediately if any ofthese problems develop.In addition, anyone who has any of these symptomswhile taking ethambutol should check with a physicianimmediately:• painful or swollen joints, especially in the knee, ankle,or big toe• a tight, hot sensation in the skin over painful or swollenjoints

Theseinclude: headache, confusion,nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, and loss of appetite.EthionamideCheck with a physician immediately if eye pain,blurred vision, or other vision changes occur while tak-ing this medicine.Symptoms such as unsteadiness, clumsiness andpain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands or feetcould be the first signs of nerve problems that maybecome more serious. If any of these symptoms occur,check with a physician immediately. Other side effectsthat should be brought to a physician’s attention immedi-ately include yellow eyes or skin and mood or mentalchanges such as depression or confusion.Less serious side effects such as dizziness, nausea orvomiting, appetite loss, sore mouth, or metallic taste mayalso occur. These problems usually go away as the bodyadjusts to the medicine. They do not need medical atten-tion unless they continue or they interfere with normalactivities.IsoniazidThis medicine may cause serious liver damage,especially in people over 40 years of age. However, tak-ing medicine for tuberculosis is very important for peo-ple with the disease. Anyone who has tuberculosis andhas been advised to take this drug should thoroughly dis-cuss treatment options with his or her physician.Recognizing the early signs of liver and nerve dam-age can help prevent the problems from getting worse. Ifany of these symptoms occur, check with a physicianimmediately:• unusual tiredness or weakness• clumsiness or unsteadiness• pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands andfeet• loss of appetite• vomitingThis medicine may also cause less serious sideeffects such as diarrheaand stomach pain.

Antiulcer drugs
Definition
Antiulcer drugs are a class of drugs, exclusive of theantibacterial agents, used to treat ulcers in the stomachand the upper part of the small intestine.
Purpose
Recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers are caused byHelicobacter pyloriinfections, and are treated with com-bination treatments that incorporate antibiotic therapywith gastric acid suppression. Additionally, bismuthcompounds have been used. The primary class of drugsused for gastric acid suppression are the proton pumpinhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole andrabeprazole. The H-2 receptor blocking agents, cimeti-dine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine have been usedfor this purpose, but are now more widely used for mainte-nance therapy after treatment with the proton pumpinhibitors. Sucralfate, which acts by forming a protectivecoating over the ulcerate lesion, is also used in ulcer treat-ment and may be appropriate for patients in whom otherclasses of drugs are not indicated, or those whose gastriculcers are caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) rather than H. pyloriinfections.
Description
The proton pump inhibitors block the secretion ofgastric acid by the gastric parietal cells. The extent of inhi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 313Antiulcer drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 313bition of acid secretion is dose related. In some cases, gas-tric acid secretion is completely blocked for over 24 hourson a single dose. In addition to their role in treatment ofgastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treatsyndromes of excessive acid secretion (Zollinger-EllisonSyndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Histamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action ofhistamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secre-tion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective than theproton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a 75–79% reduc-tion in acid secretion. Higher rates of acid inhibition maybe achieved when the drug is administered by the intra-venous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be usedto treat heartburnand hypersecretory syndromes. Whengiven before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are usefulin prevention of aspiration pneumonia.Sucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar moleculewith no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid, butrather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a thickcoating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting theopen area from further damage. A secondary effect is toact as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme pepsin. Sucral-fate does not bind to the normal stomach lining. The drughas been used for prevention of stressulcers, the typeseen in patients exposed to physical stress such as burns and surgery. It has no systemic effects.
Recommended dosage
The doses of the proton pump inhibitors and H-2receptor blockers vary depending on the drug and condi-tion being treated. Consult individual references.The dose of sucralfate for acute ulcer therapy is 1gram four times a day. After the ulcer has healed, mainte-nance treatment may continue at 1 gram two times daily.
Precautions
The proton pump inhibitors are generally well toler-ated, and the most common adverse effects are diarrhea,itching, skin rash,dizzinessand headache. Muscle aches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infec-tions are among the other adverse reactions reported.Omeprazole has an increased rate of fetal deaths in ani-mal studies. It is not known if these drugs are excreted inhuman milk, but because of reported adverse effects toinfants in animal studies, it is recommended that protonpump inhibitors not be used by nursing mothers.The H-2 receptor blockers vary widely in theiradverse effects. Although they are generally well tolerat-ed, cimetidine may cause confusion in elderly patients,and has an antiandrogenic effect that may cause sexual dysfunctionin males. Famotidine has been reported tocause headache in 4.7% of patients. It is advisable thatmothers not take H-2 receptor blockers while nursing.Sucralfate is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed,and its most common side effect is constipationin 2% of patients. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort,indigestion, flatulence,dry mouth, rash, pruritus (itch-ing), back pain, headache, dizziness, sleepiness, and ver-tigo have been reported, as well as rare allergic respons-es. Because sucralfate releases small amounts of alu-minum into the system, it should be used with caution inpatients with renal insufficiency. There is no informationavailable about sucralfate’s safety in breastfeeding.Interactions
Proton pump inhibitors may increase the pH of thestomach. This will inactivate some antifungal drugs thatrequire an acid medium for effectiveness, notable itra-conazole and ketoconazole.H-2 receptor blocking agents have a large number ofdrug interactions. Consult individualized references.Sucralfate should not be used with aluminum con-taining antacids, because of the risk of increased alu-minum absorption. Sucralfate may inhibit absorption andreduce blood levels of anticoagulants, digoxin, quinidine,ketoconazole, quinolones and phenytoin.

Definition
Antiviral drugs are medicines that cure or controlvirus infections.
Purpose
Antivirals are used to treat infections caused byviruses. Unlike antibacterial drugs, which may cover awide range of pathogens, antiviral agents tend to be nar-row in spectrum, and have limited efficacy.
Description
Exclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV(AIDS) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviraldrugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir(Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Val-trex) are effective against herpesvirus, including herpeszoster and herpes genitalis. They may also be of value ineither conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpoxand shingles. These drugs are not curative, but mayreduce the painof a herpes outbreak and shorten theperiod of viral shedding.Amantadine (Symmetrel), oseltamivir (Tamiflu),rimantidine (Flumadine), and zanamivir (Relenza) areuseful in treatment of influenzavirus. Amantadine,rimantadine, and oseltamivir may be administeredthroughout the flu season as preventatives for patientswho cannot take influenza virus vaccine.Cidofovir (Vistide), foscarnet (Foscavir), and ganci-clovir (Cytovene) have been beneficial in treatment ofcytomegalovirus in immunosupressed patients, primarilyHIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Ribavirin(Virazole) is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus. Incombination with interferons, ribavirin has shown someefficacy against hepatitis C, and there have been anecdo-tal reports of utility against other types of viral infections.As a class, the antivirals are not curative, and must beused either prophylactically or early in the developmentof an infection. Their mechanism of action is typically toinactivate the enzymes needed for viral replication. Thiswill reduce the rate of viral growth, but will not inactivethe virus already present. Antiviral therapy must normallybe initiated within 48 hours of the onset of an infection toprovide any benefit. Drugs used for influenza may beused throughout the influenza season in high risk patients,or within 48 hours of exposure to a known carrier. Anti-herpetic agents should be used at the first signs of an out-break. Anti-cytomegaloviral drugs must routinely be usedas part of a program of secondary prophylaxis(mainte-

Precautions
Ganciclovir is available in intravenous injection, oralcapsules, and intraoccular inserts. The capsules should bereserved for prophylactic use in organ transplant patients,or for HIV infected patients who cannot be treated withthe intravenous drug. The toxicity profile of this drugwhen administered systemically includes granulocytope-nia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The drug is in preg- nancycategory C, but has caused significant fetal abnor-malities in animal studies including cleft palate and organdefects. Breast feeding is not recommended.Cidofovir causes renal toxicity in 53% of patients.Patients should be well hydrated, and renal functionshould be checked regularly. Other common adverseeffects are nausea and vomitingin 65% or patients,asthenia in 46% and headacheand diarrhea, both reported in 27% of cases. The drug is category C in preg-nancy, due to fetal abnormalities in animal studies.Breast feeding is not recommended.Foscarnet is used in treatment of immunocompro-mised patients with cytomegalovirus infections and inacyclovir-resistant herpes simples virus. The primaryhazard is renal toxicity. Alterations in electrolyte levelsmay cause seizures. Foscarnet is category C during preg-nancy. The drug has caused skeletal abnormailities indeveloping fetuses. It is not known whether foscarnet isexcreted in breast milk, however the drug does appear inbreast milk in animal studies.Valaciclovir is metabolized to acyclovir, so that thehazards of the two drugs are very similar.

They are both pregnancy category B.Although there have been no reports of fetal abnormali-ties attributable to either drug, the small number of report-ed cases makes it impossible to draw conclusions regard-ing safety in pregnancy. Acyclovir is found in breast milk,but no adverse effects have been reported in the newborn.Famciclovir is similar in actions and adverse effects.Ribavirin is used by aerosol for treatment of hospital-ized infants and young children with severe lower respira-tory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus(RSV).

Anxiety
Definition
Anxiety is a multisystem response to a perceivedthreat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemicalchanges in the body, the patient’s personal history andmemory, and the social situation. As far as we know, anxi-ety is a uniquely human experience. Other animals clearlyknow fear, but human anxiety involves an ability, to usememory and imagination to move backward and forwardin time, that animals do not appear to have. The anxietythat occurs in post-traumatic syndromes indicates thathuman memory is a much more complicated mental func-tion than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion ofhuman anxiety is produced by anticipation of futureevents. Without a sense of personal continuity over time,people would not have the “raw materials” of anxiety.It is important to distinguish between anxiety as afeeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a psy-chiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious withouthaving an anxiety disorder. Also a person facing a clearand present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con-sidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxietyfrequently occurs as a symptom in other categories ofpsychiatric disturbance.
Description
Although anxiety is a commonplace experience thateveryone has from time to time, it is difficult to describeconcretely because it has so many different potential caus-es and degrees of intensity. Doctors sometimes categorizeanxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether itis being described by the person having it (emotion) or byan outside observer (affect). The word emotionis general-ly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state thatunderlie a person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affectis used to describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’sperspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an anxiousaffect, he or she means that the patient appears nervous oranxious, or responds to others in an anxious way (forexample, the individual is shaky, tremulous, etc.).Although anxiety is related to fear, it is not the samething. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific eventor object, and the person is consciously aware of it. Mostpeople will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun atthem or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon. Theyalso will recognize that they are afraid. Anxiety, on theother hand, is often unfocused, vague, and hard to pindown to a specific cause. In this form it is called free-float-ing anxiety. Sometimes anxiety being experienced in thepresent may stem from an event or person that producedpainand fear in the past, but the anxious individual is notconsciously aware of the original source of the feeling. Itis anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes it hard forpeople to compare their experiences of it. Whereas mostpeople will be fearful in physically dangerous situations,and can agree that fear is an appropriate response in thepresence of danger, anxiety is often triggered by objects orevents that are unique and specific to an individual. Anindividual might be anxious because of a unique meaningor memory being stimulated by present circumstances, notbecause of some immediate danger. Another individuallooking at the anxious person from the outside may betruly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s anxiety.
Causes and symptoms
Anxiety can have a number of different causes. It isa multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’senvironment, or a response to an internal stimulus (forexample, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum-bling) resulting from a combination of general biologicaland individual psychological processes.
Physical
In some cases, anxiety is produced by physical respons-es to stress, or by certain disease processes or medications.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 317AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 317THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The ner- vous system of human beings is “hard-wired” to respondto dangers or threats. These responses are not subject toconscious control, and are the same in humans as inlower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptationto the animal predators and other dangers with which allanimals, including primitive humans, had to cope. Themost familiar reaction of this type is the so-called “fight-or-flight” reaction. This response is the human organ-ism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation.It is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousalmarked by high muscle tension and strong feelings offear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac-tion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises.They become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate,their heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases,and their digestion slows down, allowing more energy tobe available to the muscles.This emergency reaction is regulated by a part of thenervous system called the autonomic nervous system, orANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-cialized part of the brainstem that is among a group ofstructures called the limbic system. The limbic systemcontrols human emotions through its connections toglands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and“higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor-tex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbicsystem cannot tell the difference between a realisticphysical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.The hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-mones by the pituitary gland, even when there is noexternal and objective danger. A second problem iscaused by the biochemical side effects of too many “falsealarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a realdanger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones byrunning away or by fighting. In modern life, however,people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations inwhich they can neither run away nor lash out physically.As a result, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi-cal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them.These biochemical changes can produce anxious feel-ings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp-toms associated with anxiety. They may even producepermanent changes in the brain, if the process occursrepeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such ascoronary artery disease, may be worsened by anxiety,as chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart,stomach, and other organs.
DISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp-tom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis-eases are disorders of the endocrine system, such asCushing’s syndrome(overproduction of cortisol by theadrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity of thethyroid gland. Other medical conditions that can produceanxiety include respiratory distress syndrome,mitral valve prolapse, porphyria, and chest pain caused byinadequate blood supply to the heart (anginapectoris).MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerousmedications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a sideeffect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid orasthmadrugs; some psychotropic agents; occasionally,local anesthetics; corticosteroids; antihypertensivedrugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(like flurbiprofen and ibuprofen).Although people do not usually think of caffeineas a drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con-sumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf-feine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,coffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially colabeverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptomssimply by reducing their intake of these substances.Withdrawal from certain prescription drugs, primari-ly beta blockersand corticosteroids, can cause anxiety.Withdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety.Learned associationsSome aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidablebyproducts of the human developmental process.Humans are unique among animals in that they spend anunusually long period of early life in a relatively helplesscondition, and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxi-ety. The extended period of human dependency on adultsmeans that people may remember, and learn to antici-pate, frightening or upsetting experiences long beforethey are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery overtheir environment. In addition, the fact that anxiety dis-ordersoften run in families indicates that children canlearn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents, aswell as healthy ones. Also, recurrent disorders in familiesmay indicate that there is a genetic or inherited compo-nent in some anxiety disorders. For example, there hasbeen found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders(panic) in identical twins than in fraternal twins.
CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY. Re- searchers in early childhood development regard anxietyin adult life as a residue of childhood memories ofdependency. Humans learn during the first year of lifethat they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur-vival depends on the care of others. It is thought that thisearly experience of helplessness underlies the most com-mon anxieties of adult life, including fear of powerless-ness and fear of being unloved. Thus, adults can be madeanxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 318AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 318and/or significant relationships, even though they are nolonger helpless children.
SYMBOLIZATION. The psychoanalytic model givesconsiderable weight to the symbolic aspect of humananxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,compulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highlyindividualized. The length of the human maturationprocess allows many opportunities for children and ado-lescents to connect their experiences with certain objectsor events that can bring back feelings in later life. Forexample, a person who was frightened as a child by a tallman wearing glasses may feel panicky years later bysomething that reminds him of that person or experiencewithout consciously knowing why.Freud thought that anxiety results from a person’sinternal conflicts. According to his theory, people feelanxious when they feel torn between desires or urgestoward certain actions, on the one hand, and moralrestrictions, on the other. In some cases, the person’sanxiety may attach itself to an object that represents theinner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxiousaround money may be pulled between a desire to stealand the belief that stealing is wrong. Money becomes asymbol for the inner conflict between doing what is con-sidered right and doing what one wants.
PHOBIAS. Phobiasare a special type of anxietyreaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated ona specific object or situation that the person then tries toavoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of all pro-portion to its “cause.” Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis-tical Manual of Mental Disorders,4th edition (DSM-IV),these specific phobias were called simple phobias. It isestimated that 10-11% of the population will develop aphobia in the course of their lives. Some phobias, such asagoraphobia(fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fearof small or confined spaces), and social phobia, areshared by large numbers of people. Others are less com-mon or unique to the patient.Social and environmental stressorsAnxiety often has a social dimension becausehumans are social creatures. People frequently reportfeelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and, there-fore, fear the loss of social approval or love. Social phobiais a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levelsof anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations.Another social stressor is prejudice. People whobelong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher riskfor developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, forexample, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis-orderamong women reflects their greater social andeconomic vulnerability.Some controversial studies indicate that the increasein violent or upsetting pictures and stories in newsreports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level ofmany people. Stress and anxiety management programsoften suggest that patients cut down their exposure toupsetting stimuli.Anxiety may also be caused by environmental oroccupational factors. People who must live or workaround sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,chemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannotavoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.Existential anxietyAnother factor that shapes human experiences ofanxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans arethe only animals that appear to be aware of their limitedlife span. Some researchers think that awareness ofdeathinfluences experiences of anxiety from the timethat a person is old enough to understand death.Symptoms of anxietyIn order to understand the diagnosis and treatment ofanxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of itssymptoms. SOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms ofanxiety include headaches,dizzinessor lightheadedness,nausea and/or vomiting,diarrhea, tingling, pale com-plexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, andsensations of tightness in the chest, neck, shoulders, orhands. These symptoms are produced by the hormonal,muscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in thefight-or-flight reaction.
BEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxietyinclude pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper-ventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or fingertapping.
COGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety includerecurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor-bid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion, orinability to concentrate.
EMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxietyinclude tension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or“keyed up,” and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.
DEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,the symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from oractivate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms.Because of these defenses, it is possible for a person tobe anxious without being consciously aware of it orappearing anxious to others. These psychological defens-es include:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 319AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 319• Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts orideas out of conscious awareness.• Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached to adifferent object or event. Phobias are an example of themechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory.• Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious feel-ings by saying that any normal person would feel anx-ious in their situation.• Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of phys-ical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrentheadaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.• Delusion formation. The person converts anxious feel-ings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas withoutreality testing. Delusion formation can involve groupsas well as individuals.Other theorists attribute some drug addictionto the desire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,they argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub-stances or behaviors to “medicate” anxious feelings.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complexbecause of the variety of its causes and the highly personal-ized and individualized nature of its symptom formation.There are no medical tests that can be used to diagnoseanxiety by itself. When a doctor examines an anxiouspatient, he or she will first rule out physical conditions anddiseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from theseexclusions, the physical examinationis usually inconclu-sive. Some anxious patients may have their blood pressureor pulse rate affected by anxiety, or may look pale or per-spire heavily, but others may appear physically completelynormal. The doctor will then take the patient’s medication,dietary, and occupational history to see if they are takingprescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if they areabusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs, if they are con-suming large amounts of caffeine, or if their workplace isnoisy or dangerous. In most cases, the most importantsource of diagnostic information is the patient’s psycholog-ical and social history. The doctor may administer a briefpsychological test to help evaluate the intensity of thepatient’s anxiety and some of its features. Some tests thatare often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and theAnxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doc-tors will check a number of chemical factors in the blood,such as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.
Treatment
Not all patients with anxiety require treatment, butfor more severe cases, treatment is recommended.Because anxiety often has more than one cause and isexperienced in highly individual ways, its treatment usu-ally requires more than one type of therapy. In addition,there is no way to tell in advance how patients willrespond to a specific drug or therapy. Sometimes the doc-tor will need to try different medications or methods oftreatment before finding the best combination for theparticular patient. It usually takes about six to eightweeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of atreatment regimen.MedicationsMedications are often prescribed to relieve the phys-ical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most agentswork by counteracting the biochemical and muscularchanges involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Somework directly on the chemicals in the brain that arethought to underlie the anxiety.ANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes calledtranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi- azepinesor barbiturates. Barbiturates, once commonlyused, are now rarely used in clinical practice. Barbitu-rates work by slowing down the transmission of nerveimpulses from the brain to other parts of the body. Theyinclude such drugs as phenobarbital (Luminal) and pen-tobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relax-ing the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic system.They include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide (Librium)and diazepam (Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodi-azepines are potentially habit-forming and may causewithdrawal symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far lesslikely than barbiturates to cause physical dependency.Both drugs also increase the effects of alcohol andshould never be taken in combination with it.Two other types of anxiolytic medications includemeprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, andbuspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that appearsto work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s ownemotion-regulating brain chemicals. Buspirone has sever-al advantages over other anxiolytics. It does not causedependence problems, does not interact with alcohol, anddoes not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operatemachinery. However, buspirone is not effective againstcertain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder.
ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor-derand panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treatdepression,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment ofchoice. Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms ofdepression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant med-ications for anxious/depressed patients. While SSRIs are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 320AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 320more common, antidepressants are sometimes pre-scribed, including tricyclic antidepressants such asimipramine (Tofranil) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors) such as phenelzine (Nardil).Beta-blockers are medications that work by blockingthe body’s reaction to the stress hormones that arereleased during the fight-or-flight reaction. They includedrugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin).Beta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post-traumatic anxiety symptoms. More commonly, the beta-blockers are given to patients with a mild form of socialphobic anxiety, such as fear of public speaking.PsychotherapyMost patients with anxiety will be given some form ofpsychotherapy along with medications. Many patientsbenefit from insight-oriented therapies, which aredesigned to help them uncover unconscious conflicts anddefense mechanisms in order to understand how theirsymptoms developed. Patients who are extremely anxiousmay benefit from supportive psychotherapy, which aims atsymptom reduction rather than personality restructuring.Two newer approaches that work well with anxiouspatients are cognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT), andrelaxation training. In CBT, the patient is taught to identifythe thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxi-ety, and to view them more realistically. In the behavioralpart of the program, the patient is exposed to the anxiety-provoking object, situation, or internal stimulus (like arapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desen-sitized to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimescalled anxiety management training, includes breathingexercises and similar techniques intended to help thepatient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscletension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction. BothCBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapyas well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, sup-port groups are often helpful to anxious patients, becausethey provide a social network and lessen the embarrass-ment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms.PsychosurgerySurgery on the brain is very rarely recommended forpatients with anxiety; however, some patients with severecases of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) havebeen helped by an operation on a part of the brain that isinvolved in OCD. Normally, this operation is attemptedafter all other treatments have failed.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety ofapproaches. Meditationand mindfulness training arethought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-der. Hydrotherapyis useful to some anxious patientsbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-tem. Yoga, aikido,t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patientswork with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.Homeopathyand traditional Chinese medicineapproach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based onother associated symptoms and the patient’s general con-stitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockageof qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is mostlikely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow.The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc- turepoint locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qiand rebalance the entire system in relation to the lungand large intestine.Aromatherapyusing essential oils can also be ben-eficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-trols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-vous system.Prognosis
The prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends onthe specific disorder and a wide variety of factors,including the patient’s age, sex, general health, living sit-uation, belief system, social support network, andresponses to different anxiolytic medications and formsof therapy.
Prevention
Humans have significant control over thoughts, and,therefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety bychanging irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans also havesome power over anxiety arising from social and envi-ronmental conditions. Other forms of anxiety, however,are built into the human organism and its life cycle, andcannot be prevented or eliminated.Resources

Definition
The anxietydisorders are a group of mental distur-bances characterized by anxiety as a central or core symp-tom. Although anxiety is a commonplace experience, noteveryone who experiences it has an anxiety disorder. Anx-iety is associated with a wide range of physical illnesses,medication side effects, and other psychiatric disorders.The revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-ual of Mental Disorders (DSM)that took place after1980 brought major changes in the classification of theanxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists classifiedpatients on the basis of a theory of causality that definedanxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in thepatient’s mind. DSM-III(1980),DSM-III-R(1987), andDSM-IV(1994) introduced and refined a new classifica-tion that took into consideration recent discoveries aboutthe biochemical and post-traumatic origins of some typesof anxiety. The present definitions are based on the exter-nal and reported symptom patterns of the disorders ratherthan on theories about their origins.
Description
Anxiety disorders are the most common form ofmental disturbance in the United States population. It isestimated that 28 million persons suffer from an anxietydisorder every year. These disorders are a serious prob-lem for the entire society because of their interferencewith patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They alsocontribute to the high rates of alcohol and substanceabuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders are an addi-tional problem for health professionals because the phys-ical symptoms of anxiety frequently bring people to pri-mary care doctors or emergency rooms.DSM-IVdefines twelve types of anxiety disorders inthe adult population. They can be grouped under sevenheadings:• Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia. The chief characteristic of panic disorderis the occurrenceof panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrence.In clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disor-der by itself, but is typically associated with some formof panic disorder. Patients with agoraphobia are afraidof places or situations in which they might have a panicattack and be unable to leave or to find help. About25% of patients with panic disorder develop obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD).•Phobias. These include specific phobias and socialphobia. A phobia is an intense irrational fear of a spe-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 322Anxiety disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 322cific object or situation that compels the patient toavoid it. Some phobias concern activities or objects thatinvolve some risk (for example, flying or driving) butmany are focused on harmless animals or other objects.Social phobia involves a fear of being humiliated,judged, or scrutinized. It manifests itself as a fear ofperforming certain functions in the presence of others,such as public speaking or using public lavatories.• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder ismarked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent thoughts orrepetitive behaviors that reflect the patient’s anxiety orattempts to control it. It affects between 2-3% of thepopulation and is much more common than was previ-ously thought.•Stressdisorders. These include post-traumatic stressdisorder(PTSD) and acute stress disorder. Stress dis-orders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic events inthe patient’s life.•Generalized anxiety disorder(GAD). GAD is themost commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and occursmost frequently in young adults.• Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes. Theseinclude general medical conditions or substance abuse.• Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last cate-gory is not a separate type of disorder, but is included tocover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSM-IV criteria for other anxiety disorders.All DSM-IVanxiety disorder diagnoses include acriterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe enoughto interfere significantly with the patient’s occupationalor educational functioning, social activities or close rela-tionships, and other customary activities.The anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequencyof occurrence in the general population, age of onset,family patterns, and gender distribution. The stress disor-ders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditionsor substance abuse are less age- and gender-specific.Whereas OCD affects males and females equally, GAD,panic disorder, and specific phobias all affect womenmore frequently than men. GAD and panic disorders aremore likely to develop in young adults, while phobiasand OCD can begin in childhood.Anxiety disorders in children and adolescentsDSM-IVdefines one anxiety disorder as specific tochildren, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This disor-der is defined as anxiety regarding separation from homeor family that is excessive or inappropriate for the child’sage. In some children, separation anxiety takes the formof school avoidance.Children and adolescents can also be diagnosed withpanic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder,and the post- traumatic stress syndromes.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of anxiety include a variety of individualand general social factors, and may produce physical,cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms. Thepatient’s ethnic or cultural background may also influ-ence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxiety.Genetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalitiesmay also play a role.Anxiety in children may be caused by suffering fromabuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated bythe variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disor-ders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Manypatients who suffer from anxiety disorders have featuresor symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whoseanxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder,such as schizophreniaor major depression, are not diag-nosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining ananxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseasesthat are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to takethe patient’s medication history, in order to exclude sideeffects of prescription drugs. Most doctors will ask aboutcaffeineconsumption to see if the patient’s dietary habitsare a factor. The patient’s work and family situation willalso be discussed. Laboratory tests for blood sugar andthyroid function are also commonDiagnostic testing for anxietyThere are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi-ety, although the doctor may order some specific tests torule out disease conditions. Although there is no psychi-atric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety dis-orders, there are several short-answer interviews or symp-tom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the inten-sity of a patient’s anxiety and some of its associated fea-tures. These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scaleand the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).
Treatment
For relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapyalone may suffice. In general, doctors prefer to use a com-bination of medications and psychotherapy with moreseverely anxious patients. Most patients respond better toa combination of treatment methods than to either med-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 323Anxiety disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 323ications or psychotherapy in isolation. Because of thevariety of medications and treatment approaches that areused to treat anxiety disorders, the doctor cannot predictin advance which combination will be most helpful to aspecific patient. In many cases the doctor will need to trya new medication or treatment over a six- to eight-weekperiod in order to assess its effectiveness. Treatment trialsdo not necessarily mean that the patient cannot be helpedor that the doctor is incompetent.Although anxiety disorders are not always easy todiagnose, there are several reasons why it is important forpatients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help. Anxi-ety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often progresses topanic attacks, phobias, and episodes of depression.Untreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diag-nosis of major depression, or interfere with the patient’seducation or ability to keep a job. In addition, many anx-ious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol whenthey try to “medicate” their symptoms. Moreover, sincechildren learn ways of coping with anxiety from their par-ents, adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a bet-ter position to help their families cope with factors thatlead to anxiety than those who remain untreated.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety ofapproaches. Meditationand mindfulness training arethought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-der. Hydrotherapyis useful to some anxious patientsbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-tem. Yoga, aikido,t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patientswork with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.Homeopathyand traditional Chinese medicineapproach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on otherassociated symptoms and the patient’s general constitution.Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qi,o r vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most likely toaffect the lung and large intestine meridian flow. The practi-tioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupuncturepoint locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalancethe entire system in relation to the lung and large intestine.Aromatherapyusing essential oils can also be ben-eficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-trols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-vous system.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery depends on the specificdisorder, the severity of the patient’s symptoms, the spe-KEY TERMS

Aortic aneurysm
Definition
An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or swelling ofa portion of a blood vessel. The aorta, which can developthese abnormal bulges, is the large blood vessel that car-ries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest ofthe body.
Description
The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, andis therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is anartery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin innerlayer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel itsflexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and afiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to notburst when the heart pumps blood to the body.Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness developsin part of the wall of the aorta; three basic types are usual-ly found. If all three layers of the vessel are affected andweakness develops along an extended area of the vessel,the weakened area will appear as a large, bulging regionof blood vessel; this is called a fusiform aneurysm. Ifweakness develops between the inner and outer layers ofthe aortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the interiorof the vessel is pushed around the damaged region in thewall and collects between these layers. This is called adissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” orseparated from another. If damage occurs to only the mid-dle (muscular) layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge canform; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm.
Causes and symptoms
Aortic aneurysms occur in different portions of theaorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and travelsdownward through the abdomen. Aneurysms found inthe region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracicaortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that occur in the part of theaorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aorticaneurysms.Thoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produceany noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysmbecomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, orabdominal paincan result. Abdominal aortic aneurysmsoccur more often in men, and these aneurysms can causepain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painfulabdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that theaneurysm could burst very soon.Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused byatherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostlycholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the innerwall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to theaortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak andoften results in an aneurysm or bulge.Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown ofthe muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by highblood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and althoughrare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta.

Silent, stable aneurysms are often detected when aperson has an x ray as part of a routine examination orfor other medical reasons. Otherwise, when chest,abdominal, or back pain is severe, aortic aneurysm issuspected and x-ray (radiographic) studies can confirmor rule out that condition.
Treatment
Aortic aneurysms are potentially life-threatening con-ditions. Small aneurysms should be monitored for their rateof growth and large aneurysms require consideration for asurgical repair. The most common method of surgicalrepair is to cut out the bulging section of artery wall andsew a Dacron fiber material into its place in the vessel wall.
Prognosis
Only 1-2% of people die from having surgical repairof an aortic aneurysm. However, if the aneurysm isuntreated and eventually ruptures, less than half of thepeople with ruptured aneurysms will survive. The chal-lenge for the physician is to decide when or if to do thepreventive surgery.Prevention
Aneuryms can develop in people with atherosclerosis.High blood pressure can also lead to this condition. Althoughno definite prevention exists, lifestyle and dietary changesthat help lower blood pressure and the amount of fat in theblood stream may slow the development of aneurysms.Resources

Aortic dissection
Definition
Aortic dissection is a rare, but potentially fatal, con-dition in which blood passes through the inner lining andbetween the layers of the aorta. The dissecting aorta usu-ally does not burst, but has an abnormal second channelwithin it.
Description
A defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows anopening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main artery ofthe body and is an area of high blood pressure. When adefect develops, blood pressure can force the tear to openand allow blood to pass through. Since the blood is underpressure, it eventually splits (dissecting) the middle layerof the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood.The length of the channel grows over time and can resultin the closing off of connection points to other arteries.This can lead to heart attack, strokes, abdominal pain, and nerve damage. Blood may leak from the dissectionand collect in the chest an around the heart.A second mechanism leading to aortic dissection ismedial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in themiddle layer of the blood vessel and spills through theinner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then allowsblood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin adissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of aortic dissec-tion occur yearly in the United States.
Causes and symptoms
Aortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of theinner lining of the aorta. There are a number of condi-tions that predispose a person to develop defects of theinner lining, including high blood pressure, Marfan’s dis-ease,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective tissue dis-eases, and defects of heart development which begin dur-ing fetal development. A dissection can also occur acci-dentally following insertion of a catheter, trauma, orsurgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. Thepain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient andcause him to fall to the ground. The pain is frequentlyfelt in both the chest and in the back, between the shoul-der blades. The extent of the pain is proportional to thelength of the dissection.
Diagnosis
The pain experienced by the patient is the first symp-tom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is usuallydescribed by the patient as “tearing, ripping, or stabbing.”This is in contrast to the pain associated with heartattacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or absentpulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard if thedissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta will usu-ally appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams ofmost patients. The use of a blood dye in angiogramsand/or CT scans (computed tomography scans) will aid in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.
Treatment
Because of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis-section, patients are treated immediately. Drugs areadministered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate.If the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may beused. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery,damaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthet-ic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel.
Prognosis
Depending on the nature and extent of the dissection,deathcan occur within a few hours of the start of a dis-section. Approximately 75% of untreated people die with-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 327Aortic dissectionGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 327in two weeks of the start of a dissection. Of those who aretreated, 40% survive more than 10 years. Patients are usu-ally given long term treatment with drugs to reduce theirblood pressure, even if they have had surgery.Resources

Aortic valve insufficiency
Definition
The aortic valve separates the left ventricle of theheart (the heart’s largest pumping chamber) from theaorta, the large artery that carries oxygen-rich blood outof the left ventricle to the rest of the body. In aortic valveinsufficiency, the aortic valve becomes leaky, causingblood to flow backwards into the left ventricle.
Description
Aortic valve insufficiency occurs when this valvecannot properly close after blood that is leaving theheart’s left ventricle enters the aorta. With each contrac-tion of the heart more and more blood flows back into theKEY TERMS
Dissection—A cut or divide.Hemorrhage—A large discharge of blood, profusebleeding.left ventricle, causing the ventricle to become overfilled.This larger-than-normal amount of blood that collects inthe left ventricle puts pressure on the walls of the heart,causing the heart muscle to increase in thickness (hyper-trophy). If this thickening continues, the heart can be per-manently damaged.Aortic valve insufficiency is also know as aorticvalve regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flowof blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve.
Causes and symptoms
The faulty working of the aortic valve can be causedby a birth defect; by abnormal widening of the aorta (whichcan be caused by very high blood pressure and a variety ofother less common conditions); by various diseases thatcause large amounts of swelling (inflammation) in differentareas of the body, like rheumatic fever; and, althoughrarely, by the sexually transmitted disease,syphilis.About 75% of people with aortic valve insufficiencyare men. Rheumatic (inflammatory) diseases have beenthe main cause of this condition in both men and women.Aortic valve insufficiency can remain unnoticed for10 to 15 years. In cases of severe insufficiency a personmay notice a variety of symptoms, including an uncom-fortable pounding of the heart when lying down, a veryrapid or hard heart beat (palpitations),shortness ofbreath, chest pain, and if untreated for very long times,swelling of the liver, ankles, and belly.
Diagnosis
A poorly functioning or insufficient aortic valve canbe identified when a doctor listens to the heart during aphysical examination. A chest x ray, an electrocardio-gram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heart beats), aswell as an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound wavesto create an image of the heart and its valves), can furtherevaluate or confirm the condition.
Treatment
Aortic insufficiency is usually corrected by havingthe defective valve surgically replaced. However, such anoperation is done in severe cases. Before the conditionworsens, certain drugs can be used to help manage thiscondition.Drugs that remove water from the body, drugs thatlower blood pressure, and drugs that help the heart beatmore effectively can each be used for this condition.Reducing the amount of salt in the diet also helps lowerthe amount of fluid the body holds and can help the heartto work more efficiently as well.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 328Aortic valve insufficiencyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 328In cases of a severely malfunctioning valve that hasbeen untreated for a long time, surgery is the treatment ofchoice, especially if the heart is not functioning normal-ly. Human heart valves can be replaced with man-madevalves or with valves taken from pig hearts.
Prognosis
Although drug treatment can help put off the needfor surgical valve replacement, it is important to replacethe faulty valve before the heart muscle itself is damagedbeyond recovery.Resources

Aortic valve stenosis
Definition
When aortic valve stenosis occurs, the aortic valve,located between the aorta and left ventricle of the heart,is narrower than normal size.
Description
A normal aortic valve, when open, allows the freeflow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta.When the valve narrows, as it does with stenosis,blood flow is impeded. Because it is more difficult forblood to flow through the valve, there is increasedstrain on the heart. This can cause the left ventricle toenlarge and malfunction, resulting in reduced bloodsupply to the heart muscle and body, as well as fluidbuild up in the lungs.
Cause and symptoms
Aortic valve stenosis can occur because of a birthdefect in the formation of the valve. Calcium depositsmay form on the valve with aging, causing the valve tobecome stiff and narrow. Stenosis can also occur as aresult of rheumatic fever. Mild aortic stenosis may pro-duce no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms,depending on the severity of the disease, are chest pain, blackouts, and difficulty breathing.

Using a stethoscope, a physician may hear a murmurand other abnormal heart sounds. An ECG, also called anelectrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of theheart. This technique and chest x raycan show evidencethat the left ventricle is enlarged. An x ray can also revealcalcium deposits on the valve, as well as congestion inthe lungs. Echocardiographycan pick up thickening ofthe valve, heart size, and whether or not the valve isworking properly. This is a procedure in which high fre-quency sound waves harmlessly bounce off organs in thebody. Cardiac catheterization, in which a contrast dyeis injected in an artery using a catheter, is the key tool toconfirm stenosis and gauge its severity.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the symptoms and how theheart’s function is affected. The valve can be opened with-out surgery by using a balloon catheter, but this is often atemporary solution. The procedure involves inserting adeflated balloon at the end of a catheter through the arteriesto the valve. Inflating the balloon should widen the valve. Insevere stenosis,heart valve replacementis recommended,most often involving open-heart surgery. The valve can bereplaced with a mechanical valve, a valve from a pig, or bymoving the patient’s other heart valve (pulmonary) into theposition of the aortic valve and then replacing the pul-monary valve with an mechanical one. Anyone with aorticstenosis needs to take antibiotics(amoxicillin, ery-thromycin, or clindamycin) before dental and some othersurgical procedures, to prevent a heart valve infection.

Apgar testing
Definition
Apgar testing is the assessment of the newborn rat-ing color, heart rate, stimulus response, muscle tone, andrespirations on a scale of zero to two, for a maximumpossible score of 10. It is performed twice, first at oneminute and then again at five minutes after birth.
Purpose
Apgar scoring was originally developed in the 1950sby the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist practi-tioners attending a birth in deciding whether or not anewborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a scoringmethod fosters consistency and standardization amongdifferent practitioners. A February 2001 study publishedin the New England Journal of Medicineinvestigatedwhether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant.Researchers concluded that “The Apgar scoring systemremains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal sur-vival today as it was almost 50 years ago”.
Description
The five areas are scored as follows:• Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1 foracrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink, butthe arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole body isblue. Newborns with naturally darker skin color willnot be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, espe-cially in the soles and palms. Color is related to theneonate’s ability to oxygenate its body and extremities,and is dependent on heart rate and respirations. A per-fectly healthy newborn will often receive a score of 9because of some blueness in the hands and feet.• Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per minute(bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no pulse.Heart rate is assessed by listening with a stethoscope tothe newborn’s heart and counting the number of beats.• Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate coughs,sneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a stimulusKEY TERMS
Acrocyanosis—A slight cyanosis, or blueness ofthe hands and feet of the neonate is considerednormal. This impaired ability to fully oxygenatethe extremities is due to an immature circulatorysystem which is still in flux.Amniotic fluid—The protective bag of fluid thatsurrounds the fetus while growing in the uterus.Neonate—A term referring to the newborn infant,from birth until one month of age.Neonatologist—A physician who specializes inproblems of newborn infants.Pallor—Extreme paleness in the color of the skin.(such as the use of nasal suctioning, stroking the backto assess for spinal abnormalities, or having the foottapped); 1 for a slight cry or grimace in response to thestimulus; 0 for no response.• Activity, or muscle tone: 2 for vigorous movements ofarms and legs; 1 for some movement; 0 for no move-ment, limpness.• Respirations: 2 for visible breathing and crying; 1 forslow, weak, irregular breathing; 0 for apnea, or nobreathing. A crying newborn can adequately oxygenateits lungs. Respirations are best assessed by watchingthe rise and fall of the neonate’s abdomen, as infants arediaphragmatic breathers.The combined first letters in these five areas spellApgar.
Preparation
No preparation is needed to perform the test. How-ever, while being born the neonate may receive nasal andoral suctioning to remove mucus and amniotic fluid. Thismay be done when the head of the newborn is safely out,while the mother rests before she continues to push.
Aftercare
Since the test is primarily observational in nature, noaftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the needfor immediate intervention or prolonged observation.

Most infants score between 7 and 10.These infants are expected to have an excellent outcome.A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires immediate intervention, usu-ally in the form of oxygen and respiratory assistance, orperhaps just suctioning if breathing has been obstructed bymucus. While suctioning is being done, a source of oxy-gen may be placed near, but not over the newborn’s noseand mouth. This form of oxygen is referred to as blow-by. A score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is hav-ing some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life. This maybe due to medications given to the mother during a diffi-cult labor, or at the very end of labor, when these medica-tions have an exaggerated effect on the neonate.
Abnormal results
With a score of 0-3, the newborn is unresponsive,apneic, pale, limp and may not have a pulse. Interven-tions to resuscitate will begin immediately. The test isrepeated at five minutes after birth and both scores aredocumented. Should the resuscitation effort continue intothe five-minute time period, interventions will not stop inorder to perform the test. The one-minute score indicatesDR. VIRGINIA APGAR (1909–1974)
the need for intervention at birth. It addresses survivaland prevention of birth-related complications resultingfrom inadequate oxygen supply. Poor oxygenation maybe due to inadequate neurological and/or chemical con-trol of respiration. The five-minute score appears to havea more predictive value for morbidity and normal devel-opment, although research studies on this are inconsis-tent in their conclusions.Resources

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 332Apgar testingAs one of very few female medical students atColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeonsin New York during the early 1930s and one of the firstwomen to graduate from its medical school, Apgar knewthat her goal of becoming a surgeon would not beachieved easily in a male-dominated profession. Reluc-tantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiol-ogy, she embraced her new field with typical intelligenceand energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a relativelynew field, having been left by the doctors mostly to theattention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately howmuch in need of scientifically trained personnel was thissignificant part of surgery, and she set out to make anes-thesiology a separate medical discipline. By 1937, shehad become the fiftieth physician to be certified as ananesthesiologist in the United States. The following yearshe was appointed director of anesthesiology at theColumbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming thefirst woman to head a department at that institution.As the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in thedelivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgarrealized that infants had died from respiratory or circulato-ry complications that early treatment could have prevent-ed. Apgar decided to bring her considerable research skillsto this childbirth dilemma, and her careful study resultedin her publication of the Apgar Score System in 1952.

Aphasia
Definition
Aphasia is condition characterized by either partialor total loss of the ability to communicate verbally orusing written words. A person with aphasia may havedifficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing thenames of objects, or understanding what other peoplehave said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as mayoccur during a traumatic accident or when the brain isdeprived of oxygen during a stroke. It may also becaused by a brain tumor, a disease such as Alzheimer’s,or an infection, like encephalitis. Aphasia may be tem-porary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speechimpediments caused by loss of muscle control.
Description
To understand and use language effectively, an indi-vidual draws upon word memory—stored information onwhat certain words mean, how to put them together, andhow and when to use them properly. For a majority ofpeople, these and other language functions are located inthe left side (hemisphere) of the brain. Damage to thisside of the brain is most commonly linked to the devel-opment of aphasia. Interestingly, however, left-handedpeople appear to have language areas in both the left andright hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, maydevelop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain.Stroke is the most common cause of aphasia in theUnited States. Approximately 500,000 individuals sufferstrokes each year, and 20% of these individuals developsome type of aphasia. Other causes of brain damageinclude head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. Abouthalf of the people who show signs of aphasia have whatis called temporary or transient aphasia and recover com-pletely within a few days. An estimated one millionAmericans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia.As yet, no connection between aphasia and age, gender,or race has been found.Aphasia is sometimes confused with other conditionsthat affect speech, such as dysarthria and apraxia. Thesecondition affect the muscles used in speaking rather thanlanguage function itself. Dysarthria is a speech distur-bance caused by lack of control over the muscles used inspeaking, perhaps due to nerve damage. Speech apraxia isa speech disturbance in which language comprehensionand muscle control are retained, but the memory of howto use the muscles to form words is not.
Causes and symptoms
Aphasia can develop after an individual sustains abrain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or infec-tion, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of this injury,the pathways for language comprehension or productionare disrupted or destroyed. For most people, this meansdamage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99%of right-handed people, language centers are in the lefthemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people alsohave left-hemisphere language dominance.) According tothe traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasiais caused by damage to a different part of the left hemi-sphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of thebasic language functions: speech, naming (the ability toidentify an object, color, or other item with an appropriateword or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words,phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the abili-ty to understand spoken language), reading (the ability tounderstand written words and their meaning), and writing(the ability to communicate and record events with text).The traditional classification scheme includes eighttypes of aphasia:• Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results fromdamage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the lan-guage-dominant area of the brain. Individuals withBroca’s aphasia may be completely unable to use speech(mutism) or may be able to use single-word statementsor even full sentences, though these sentences mayrequire a great deal of effort to construct. Small words,such as conjunctions (and, or, but) and articles (the, an,a), may be omitted, leading to a “telegraph” quality intheir speech. Hearing comprehension is usually notaffected, so they are able to understand other people’sspeech and conversation and can follow commands.Often, they may experience weakness on the right side oftheir bodies, which can make it difficult to write. Read-ing ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty find-ing the right word when speaking. Individuals withBroca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressedbecause they are aware of their language difficulties.• Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the sideportion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant area
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 333AphasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 333of the brain. Individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia speakin long, uninterrupted sentences; however, the wordsused are frequently unnecessary or even made-up. Theyhave a great deal of difficulty understanding other peo-ple’s speech, sometimes to the point of being unable tounderstand spoken language at all. Reading ability isdiminished, and although writing ability is retained,what is written may be abnormal. No physical symp-toms, such as the right-sided weakness seen withBroca’s aphasia, are typically observed. Also, in con-trast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’saphasia are not aware of their language errors.• Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to thelanguage areas of the left hemisphere. As a result, allbasic language functions are affected, but some areasmay be more affected than others. For example, an indi-vidual may have difficulty speaking but may be able towrite well. The individual may experience weaknessand loss of feeling on the right side of their body.• Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, israther uncommon. Individuals with conduction aphasiaare unable to repeat words, sentences, and phrases.Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals mayfrequently correct themselves and words may beskipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo-ken language, it may also be difficult for the individualwith conduction aphasia to find the right word todescribe a person or object. The impact of this condi-tion on reading and writing ability varies. As with othertypes of aphasia, right-sided weakness or sensory lossmay be present.• Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences anindividual’s ability to find the right name for a personor object. As a result, an object may be described ratherthan named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, read-ing, and writing are not affected, other than by thisinability to find the right name. Speech is fluent, exceptfor pauses as the individual tries to recall the rightname. Physical symptoms are variable, and some indi-viduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness orsensory loss.• Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan-guage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primarylanguage areas. There are three types of aphasia:transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory apha-sia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. All of the transcor-tical aphasias are distinguished from other types by theindividual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen-tences. Other language functions may also be impairedto varying degrees, depending on the extent and partic-ular location of brain damage.As researchers continue to learn more about thebrain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia arebeing recognized. One newly recognized type of aphasia,subcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms of other tradi-tional types of aphasia but involves language disordersthat are not typical. This type of aphasia is associatedwith injuries to areas of the brain typically not identifiedwith language and language processing.
Diagnosis
Following brain injury, an initial bedside assessment ismade to determine whether language function has beenaffected. If the individual experiences difficulty communi-cating, attempts are made to determine whether this diffi-culty arises from impaired language comprehension or animpaired ability to speak. A typical examination involveslistening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individ-ual’s ability to recognize and name objects, comprehendwhat is heard, and repeat sample words and phrases. Theindividual may also be asked to read text aloud and explainwhat the passage means. In addition, writing ability is eval-uated by having the individual copy text, transcribe dictatedtext, and write something without prompting.

Broca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe ofthe language-dominant area of the brain. Individuals withBroca’s aphasia may become mute or may be able to usesingle-word statements or full sentences, although it mayrequire great effort.Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damageto the temporal lobe of the language-dominant area of thebrain. People with this condition speak in long, uninterrupt-ed sentences, but the words used are often unnecessary andunintelligible.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 334A speech pathologist or neuropsychologist may beasked to conduct more extensive examinations using in-depth, standardized tests. Commonly used tests include theBoston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, the Western Apha-sia Battery, and possibly, the Porch Index of Speech Ability.The results of these tests indicate the severity of theaphasia and may also provide information regarding theexact location of the brain damage. This more extensivetesting is also designed to provide the information neces-sary to design an individualized speech therapy program.Further information about the location of the damage isgained through the use of imaging technology, such asmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computedtomography scans(CT).

For most individuals, however, theprimary emphasis is placed on making the most ofretained language abilities and learning to use othermeans of communication to compensate for lost lan-guage abilities.Speech therapy is tailored to meet individual needs,but activities and tools that are frequently used includethe following:•Exerciseand practice. Weakened muscles are exercisedby repetitively speaking certain words or making facialexpressions, such as smiling.• Picture cards. Pictures of everyday objects are used toimprove word recall and increase vocabulary. The

Pictures of everyday objects and activi-ties are placed together, and the individual points tocertain pictures to convey ideas and communicate withothers.• Workbooks. Reading and writing exercises are used tosharpen word recall and regain reading and writingabilities. Hearing comprehension is also redevelopedusing these exercises.• Computers. Computer software can be used to improvespeech, reading, recall, and hearing comprehension by,for example, displaying pictures and having the indi-vidual find the right word.
Prognosis
The degree to which an individual can recover lan-guage abilities is highly dependent on how much braindamage occurred and the location and cause of the origi-nal brain injury. Other factors include the individual’sage, general health, motivation and willingness to partici-pate in speech therapy, and whether the individual is leftor right handed. Language areas may be located in boththe left and right hemispheres in left-handed individuals.Left-handed individuals are, therefore, more likely todevelop aphasia following brain injury, but because theyhave two language centers, may recover more fullybecause language abilities can be recovered from eitherside of the brain. The intensity of therapy and the timebetween diagnosis and the start of therapy may alsoaffect the eventual outcome.
Prevention
Because there is no way of knowing when a stroke,traumatic head injury, or disease will occur, very littlecan be done to prevent aphasia. The extent of recovery,however, in some cases, can be affected by an individ-ual’s willingness to cooperate and participate in speechtherapy directly following the injury.Resources

Aplastic anemia
Definition
Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone mar-row greatly decreases or stops production of blood cells.
Description
The bone marrow (soft tissue which is located with-in the hard outer shell of the bones) is responsible for theproduction of all the types of blood cells. The matureforms of these cells include red blood cells, which carryoxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, whichfight infection; and platelets, which are involved in clot-ting. In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrowbecomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for gener-ating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatlydecreased in number or absent. These hematopoieticcells are replaced by large quantities of fat.Yearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people inevery one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes bothmales and females of all ages, there are two age groupsthat have an increased risk. Both young adults (between15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the age of 60)have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the generalpopulation. While the disorder occurs worldwide, youngadults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do popula-tions in North America and Europe.
Causes and symptoms
Aplastic anemia falls into three basic categories,based on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired, andhereditary.In about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is consideredto be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the disorder isunknown.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 336Aplastic anemiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 336Acquired aplastic anemia refers to those cases wherecertain environmental factors and physical conditionsseem to be associated with development of the disease.Acquired aplastic anemia can be associated with:• exposure to drugs, especially anti-cancer agents, antibi- otics, anti-inflammatory agents, seizure medications,and antithyroid drugs (drugs given to stop the function-ing of an overactive thyroid)• exposure to radiation• chemical exposure (especially to the organic solventbenzene and certain insecticides)• infection with certain viruses (especially those causingviral hepatitis, as well as Epstein-Barr virus, par-vovirus, and HIV , the virus which can cause AIDS) • pregnancy• certain other disorders, including a disease called parox-ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an autoimmune reac-tion called graft-vs-host disease (which occurs when thebody’s immune system attacks and destroys the body’sown cells), and certain connective tissue diseasesHereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare, butdoes occur in Fanconi’s anemia, Shwachman-Diamondsyndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita.Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those ofother anemias, including fatigue, weakness, tiny red-dish-purple marks (petechiae) on the skin (evidence ofpinpoint hemorrhages into the skin), evidence of abnor-mal bruising, and bleeding from the gums, nose, intes-tine, or vagina. The patient is likely to appear pale. If theanemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in theblood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sud-den appearance of a new heart murmur.
Diagnosis
The blood countin aplastic anemia will reveal lownumbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells willappear normal in size and coloration, but greatlydecreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (veryyoung red blood cells, which are usually produced ingreat numbers by the bone marrow in order to compen-sate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number.Platelets and white blood cells will also be decreased innumber, though normal in structure.A sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need tobe removed by needle (usually from the hip bone) andexamined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia is pre-sent, this examination will reveal very few or nohematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat.Treatment
The first step in the treatment of aplastic anemiainvolves discontinuing exposure to any substance thatmay be causing the disorder. Although it would seem thatblood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, infact, they only serve as a temporary help, and may com-plicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation. The most successful treatment for aplastic anemia isbone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow donor(often a sibling) must be identified. There are a number oftissue markers which must be examined to determinewhether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatiblewith the patient’s immune system. Compatibility is neces-sary to avoid complications, including the destruction ofthe donor marrow by the patient’s own immune system.Patients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans-plant can be treated with a number of agents, includingantithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide,steroids, and cyclosporine. These agents all have thepotential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects.Furthermore, not all patients respond fully to theseagents. Still, even among those patients who do have agood response, many later suffer a relapse (return) ofaplastic anemia.
Prognosis
Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness. Withouttreatment, it will almost surely progress to death. Sur- vival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosis,which type of treatment a patient is eligible for, and whatkind of response their body has to that treatment. Theworst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associatedwith very low numbers of a particular type of whiteblood cell. These patients have a high chance of dyingfrom overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 80% ofall patients treated with blood transfusions alone diewithin 18 months to two years. Patients who undergobone marrow transplantation have a 60-90% chance ofbeing cured of the disease.Resources

Appendectomy
Definition
Appendectomy is the surgical removal of the appen-dix. The appendix is a worm-shaped hollow pouchattached to the cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.
Purpose
Appendectomies are performed to treat appendici-tis, an inflamed and infected appendix.
Precautions
Since appendicitis occurs most commonly in malesbetween the ages of 10-14 and in females between the agesKEY TERMS
Bone marrow—A substance found in the cavitiesof bones, especially the long bones and the ster-num (breast bone). The bone marrow containsthose cells which are responsible for the produc-tion of the blood cells (red blood cells, whiteblood cells, and platelets).Bone marrow transplant—A procedure in which aquantity of bone marrow is extracted through aneedle from a donor, and then passed into apatient to replace the patient’s diseased or absentbone marrow.Hematopoietic cells—Those cells which arelodged within the bone marrow, and which areresponsible for producing the cells which circulatein the blood (red blood cells, white blood cells,and platelets).of 15-19, appendectomy is most often performed during thistime. The diagnosis of appendicitis is most difficult in thevery young (less than two years of age) and in the elderly.
Description
Appendectomy is considered a major surgical opera-tion. Therefore, a general surgeon must perform thisoperation in the operating room of a hospital. An anes-thesiologist is also present during the operation to admin-ister an anesthetic. Most often the anesthesiologist uses ageneral anesthetic technique whereby patients are put tosleep and made painfree by administering drugs in thevein or by agents inhaled through a tube placed in thewindpipe. Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used.After the patient is anesthetized, the general surgeoncan remove the appendix either by using the traditionalopen procedure (in which a 2-3 [5-7.6 cm] in incision ismade in the abdomen) or via laparoscopy(in which four1 in [2.5 cm] incisions are made in the abdomen).Traditional open appendectomyWhen the surgeon uses the open approach, he makesan incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Mostincisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeonthen identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and exam-ines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendixis located and brought up into the wounds. The surgeonseparates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue andits attachment to the cecum and then removes it. The sitewhere the appendix was previously attached, the cecum, isclosed and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layersand then the skin are sewn together.Laproscopic appendectomyWhen the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec-tomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length,are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or navel,and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Twoother incisions are smaller and are in the right side of thelower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a camera andspecial instruments through these incisions. With the aidof this equipment, the surgeon visually examines theabdominal organs and identifies the appendix. Similarly,the appendix is freed from all of its attachments andremoved. The place where the appendix was formerlyattached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix isremoved through one of the incisions. The instrumentsare removed and then all of the incisions are closed.Studies and opinions about the relative advantagesand disadvantages of each method are divided. A skilledsurgeon can perform either one of these procedures in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 338AppendectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 338less than one hour. However, laproscopic appendectomy(LA) always takes longer than traditional appendectomy(TA). The increased time required to do a LA increasesthe patient’s exposure to anesthetics, which increases therisk of complications. The increased time requirementalso escalates fees charged by the hospital for operatingroom time and by the anesthesiologist. Since LA alsorequires specialized equipment, the fees for its use alsoincreases the hospital charges. Patients with either opera-tion have similar pain medication needs, begin eatingdietsat comparable times, and stay in the hospital equiv-alent amounts of time. LA is of special benefit in womenin whom the diagnosis is difficult and gynecological dis-ease (such as endometriosis,pelvic inflammatory dis-ease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts, and tubal pregnancies) may be the source of pain and notappendicitis. If LA is done in these patients, the pelvicorgans can be more thoroughly examined and a definitivediagnosis made prior to removal of the appendix. Mostsurgeons select either TA or LA based on the individualneeds and circumstances of the patient.Insurance plans do cover the costs of appendectomy.Fees are charged independently by the hospital and thephysicians. Hospital charges include fees for operatingand recovery room use, diagnostic and laboratory testing,as well as the normal hospital room charges. Surgicalfees vary from region to region and range between $250-$750. The anesthesiologist’s fee depends upon the healthof the patient and the length of the operation.
Preparation
Once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and thedecision has been made to perform an appendectomy, thepatient undergoes the standard preparation for an operation.This usually takes only one to two hours and includes sign-ing the operative consents, patient identification proce-dures, evaluation by the anesthesiologist, and moving thepatient to the operating suites of the hospital. Occasionally,if the patient has been ill for a prolonged period of time orhas had protracted vomiting, a delay of few to several hoursmay be necessary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics.
Aftercare
Recovery from an appendectomy is similar to otheroperations. Patients are allowed to eat when the stomach

Usually the firstmeal is a clear liquid diet—broth, juice, soda pop, andgelatin. If patients tolerate this meal, the next meal usuallyis a regular diet. Patients are asked to walk and resume theirnormal physical activities as soon as possible. If TA wasdone, work and physical education classes may be restrict-ed for a full three weeks after the operation. If a LA wasdone, most patients are able to return to work and strenuousactivity within one to three weeks after the operation.
Risks
Certain risks are present when any operation requiresa general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity is opened.Pneumoniaand collapse of the small airways (atelecta- sis) often occurs. Patients who smoke are at a greater riskfor developing these complications. Thrombophlebitis, or inflammation of the veins, is rare but can occur if thepatient requires prolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occurbut rarely is a blood transfusionrequired. Adhesions(abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thinfibrous tissue) is a known complication of any abdominalprocedure such as appendectomy. These adhesions canlead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normalflow of intestinal contents. Herniais a complication ofany incision, However, they are rarely seen after appen-dectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in thearea of the standard appendectomy incision.The overall complication rate of appendectomydepends upon the status of the appendix at the time it isremoved. If the appendix has not ruptured the complicationrate is only about 3%. However, if the appendix has rup-tured the complication rate rises to almost 59%. Woundinfections do occur and are more common if the appendici-tis was severe, far advanced, or ruptured. An abscessmay form in the abdomen as a complication of appendicitis.Occasionally, an appendix will rupture prior to itsremoval, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.Peritonitisor a generalized infection in the abdomenwill occur. Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a rup-tured appendix includes removal of what remains of theappendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that promotethe flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of thebody), and antibiotics. Fistula formation (an abnormalconnection between the cecum and the skin) rarelyoccurs. It is only seen if the appendix has a broad attach-ment to the cecum and the appendicitis is far advancedcausing destruction of the cecum itself.
Normal results
Most patients feel better immediately after an opera-tion for appendicitis. Many patients are discharged fromthe hospital within 24 hours after the appendectomy.KEY TERMS
Abscess—A collection of pus buried deep in thetissues or in a body cavity.Anesthesiologist—A physician who has specialtraining and expertise in the delivery of anesthetics.Anesthetics—Drugs or methodologies used tomake a body area free of sensation or pain.Cecum—The beginning of the large intestine andthe place where the appendix attaches to theintestinal tract.General surgeon—A physician who has specialtraining and expertise in performing a variety ofoperations.Pelvic organs—The organs inside of the body thatare located within the confines of the pelvis. Thisincludes the bladder and rectum in both sexes andthe uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes in females.Pubis—The anterior portion of the pelvis locatedin the anterior abdomen.Thrombophlebitis—Inflammation of the veins,usually in the legs, which causes swelling and ten-derness in the affected area.Umbilicus—The navel.Others may require a longer stay—three to five days.Almost all patients are back to their normal activitieswithin three weeks.The mortality rate of appendicitis has dramaticallydecreased over time. Currently, the mortality rate is esti-mated at one to twoper 1,000,000 cases of appendicitis.Deathis usually due to peritonitis, intra abdominalabscess or severe infection following rupture.The complications associated with undiagnosed, mis-diagnosised, or delayed diagnosis of appendectomy arevery significant. The diagnosis is of appendicitis is diffi-cult and never certain. This has led surgeons to perform anappendectomy any time that they feel appendicitis is thediagnosis. Most surgeons feel that in approximately 20%of their patients, a normal appendix will be removed.Rates much lower than this would seem to indicate that thediagnosis of appendicitis was being frequently missed.Resources

Appendicitis
Definition
Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix,which is the worm-shaped pouch attached to the cecum,the beginning of the large intestine. The appendix has noknown function in the body, but it can become diseased.Appendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is leftuntreated the appendix may rupture and cause a poten-tially fatal infection.
Description
Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emer-gency found in children and young adults. One person in15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The inci-dence is highest among males aged 10-14, and amongfemales aged 15-19. More males than females developappendicitis between pubertyand age 25. It is rare in theelderly and in children under the age of two.The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing-ly severe abdominal pain. Since many different condi-tions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate diagnosis ofappendicitis can be difficult. A timely diagnosis is impor-tant, however, because a delay can result in perforation,or rupture, of the appendix. When this happens, theinfected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen,potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomencalled peritonitis.Other conditions can have similar symptoms, espe-cially in women. These include pelvic inflammatorydisease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts, tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis. Various forms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation mayalso mimic appendicitis.The treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendici-tis is an appendectomy, surgery to remove the appendix.Because of the potential for a life-threatening rupturedappendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis areoften taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of appendicitis are not well understood,but it is believed to occur as a result of one or more ofthese factors: an obstruction within the appendix, thedevelopment of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tis-sue accompanied by the deathof cells) within the appen-dix, and the invasion of bacteria.Under these conditions, bacteria may multiply with-in the appendix. The appendix may become swollen andfilled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue, consist-ing of while blood cells and cellular debris), and mayeventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the presenceof symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever, a high white blood cell count, and a fast heart rate. Very rarely,

The pain, whichmay be severe or only achy and uncomfortable, eventual-ly moves into the right lower corner of the abdomen.There, it becomes more steady and more severe, andoften increases with movement, coughing, and so forth.The abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to thetouch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates anincreased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis.Loss of appetite is very common. Nausea and vom-itingmay occur in about half of the cases and occasion-ally there may be constipationor diarrhea. The temper-ature may be normal or slightly elevated. The presence ofa fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured.
Diagnosis
A careful examination is the best way to diagnoseappendicitis. It is often difficult even for experiencedphysicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitisfrom those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, veryspecific questioning and a thorough physical examina-tionare crucial. The physician should ask questions,such as where the pain is centered, whether the pain hasshifted, and where the pain began. The physician shouldpress on the abdomen to judge the location of the painand the degree of tenderness.The typical sequence of symptoms is present in about50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less typical pat-terns may be seen, especially in pregnant women, olderpatients, and infants. In pregnant women, appendicitis iseasily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdom-inal pain and nausea from other causes. Elderly patientsmay feel less pain and tenderness than most patients,thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and leading torupture in 30% of cases. Infants and young children oftenhave diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in addition to pain.While laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno-sis, an increased white cell count may point to appendici-tis. Urinalysismay help to rule out a urinary tract infec-tion that can mimic appendicitis.Patients whose symptoms and physical examinationare compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usual-ly taken immediately to surgery, where a laparotomy(surgical exploration of the abdomen) is done to confirmthe diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis,other tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT)may be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery. Anultrasound examination of the abdomen may help toidentify an inflamed appendix or other condition thatwould explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are notof much value except when the appendix has ruptured.Often, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation isdone. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery may be recom-mended without delay if the symptoms point clearly toappendicitis. If the symptoms are not clear, surgery may bepostponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis.When appendicitis is strongly suspected in a womanof child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy(an examination of the interior of the abdomen) is sometimesrecommended before the appendectomy in order to besure that a gynecological problem, such as a rupturedovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this procedure, alighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomenthrough a small incision around the navel.A normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20% ofpatients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspectedappendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will remove a nor-mal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in thefuture. During the surgery, another specific cause for thepain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about30% of these patients.
Treatment
The treatment of appendicitis is an immediateappendectomy. This may be done by opening theabdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique,or through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller inci-sion is made through the navel. Both methods can suc-cessfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It isnot certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage overopen appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy mayhave to be switched to the open appendectomy procedurefor the successful management of the rupture. If a rup-tured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.
Prognosis
Appendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen-dectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient shouldrecover without further problems. The mortality rate incases without complications is less than 0.1%. When anappendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has developed,the likelihood is higher for complications, with slowerrecovery, or death from disease. There are higher rates ofperforation and mortality among children and the elderly.
Prevention
Appendicitis is probably not preventable, althoughthere is some indication that a diet high in green vegeta-bles and tomatoes may help prevent appendicitis.

Applied kinesiology
Definition
Applied kinesiology (AK) is the study of musclesand the relationship of muscle strength to health. Itincorporates a system of manual muscle testing andtherapy. AK is based on the theory that an organ dys-function is accompanied by a specific muscle weakness.Diseases are diagnosed through muscle-testing proce-dures and then treated. AK is not the same as kinesiolo-gy, or biomechanics, which is the scientific study ofmovement.KEY TERMS
Appendectomy (or appendicectomy)—Surgicalremoval of the appendix.Appendix—The worm-shaped pouch attached tothe cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.Laparotomy—Surgical incision into the loin,between the ribs and the pelvis, which offers sur-geons a view inside the abdominal cavity.Peritonitis—Inflammation of the peritoneum,membranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.Purpose
AK is not designed for crisis medicine. For example,an AK practitioner cannot cure cancer, arthritis, dia-betes, heart disease, or infections. This therapy isdesigned to be a part of a holistic approach to preventivemedicine. The goals of AK are to (1) restore normalnerve function, (2) achieve normal endocrine, immune,digestive, and other internal organ functions, (3) inter-vene early in degenerative processes to prevent or delaypathological conditions, and to (4) restore postural bal-ance, correct gait (walking) impairment, and improverange of motion.
Description
OriginsAK is based on principles of functional neurology,anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and biochemistry aswell as principles from Chinese medicine,acupuncture, and massage. It was developed from traditional kinesiolo-gy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor fromDetroit, Michigan. He observed that each large musclerelates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle may meanthat there is a problem in the associated organ. Goodheartfound that by treating the muscle and making it strongagain, he was able to improve the function of the organ aswell. For example, if a particular nutritional supplementwas given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it wasthe correct supplement for the patient. If the muscleremained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatmentcan be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart alsofound that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat-ed with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle,he was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findingsin 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the firstmethod developed in AK. Other diagnostic and therapeuticprocedures were developed for various reflexes describedby other chiropractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporat-ed acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading thewritings of Felix Mann, M.D.Goodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic toolthat incorporates feedback from the body. He said that“applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the bodylanguage never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscleswere indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weaknesshas been ascertained, the problem may be solved in avariety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problemcorrectly, he believed, making the proper and adequatediagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory bothto the doctor and to the patient.According to AK, each muscle in the body relates toa specific meridian or energy pathway (acupuncture
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 343Applied kinesiologyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 343lines) in the body. These meridians also relate to organsor glands, allowing the muscles to provide informationabout organ or gland function and energy. The five areasof diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are(1) the nervous system, (2) the lymphatic system, (3) thevascular (blood vessel) system, (4) the cerebrospinal sys-tem, and (5) the meridian system.The first part of AK is muscle testing, which is usedto help diagnose what part of the body is functioningabnormally. Muscle testing involves putting the bodyinto a position that requires a certain muscle to remaincontracted, and then applying pressure against the mus-cle. The testing does not measure strength but is meant toreveal stresses and imbalances in the body through thetension in the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of acontrolling system (like the nervous system) to adapt themuscle to meet the changing pressure of the examiner’stest. AK practitioners also examine structural factorssuch as posture, gait, and range of motion. Some chiro-GEORGE GOODHEART (1918– )
Dr. George Goodheart was born in Detroit, Michi-gan, in 1918 and became a second-generation doctor ofchiropractic. He graduated from the National College ofChiropractic in 1939 and is recognized as the founderand developer of Applied Kinesiology. After he joinedthe U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War II,he received a promotion to major at the age of 22. Hewas the youngest ever to attain that rank. He served inactive duty from 1941-1946 and continued as a mem-ber of the Air Force Reserve until the mid-1950s.Dr. Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc-tion during his career, including director of the NationalChiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and directorfor the International College of Applied Kinesiology-U.S.A. He also lectured and taught throughout the Unit-ed States, Japan, Europe, and Australia; and he was theofficial doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed WinterOlympic Games in 1980. He contributes to a variety oftrade publications on a regular basis.In 1998 Dr. Goodheart received a LifetimeAchievement Award from the International College ofKinesiology. Earlier, in 1987 he was honored with theLeonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for theAchievement of Human Potential, and he was cited forhis research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiro-practic. He represented the State of Michigan as a dele-gate to the American Chiropractic Association and wasa fellow at the International College of Chiropractic. Heresides with his wife, JoAnn in Grosse Pointe Woods,Michigan, where he enjoys skiing and tennis.practors use AK to help them evaluate the success ofspinal adjustment. A leg muscle is tested for strength orweakness to determine whether the adjustments made areappropriate.According to AK, common internal causes of mus-cle weakness include:• dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interferencebetween spine and muscles)• impairment of lymphatic drainage• reduction of blood supply• abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerve-to-muscle relationships• blockage of an acupuncture meridian• imbalance of chemicals• dysfunction of organs or glands• excesses or deficiencies in nutritionPhysiological reactions to chemicals, includingthose associated with nutrition and allergies, may also beevaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi-cal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’stongue so that he tastes the material, and the normalchemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, thesubstances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi-tioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern todetermine where or if there is a strength or weakness.The patient does not need to swallow the substance for achange in strength or weakness to be identified. David S.Walther, a diplomate of the International College ofApplied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possiblethat the central nervous system, recognizing the com-pound being ingested, relays information to the organsand glands preparing for use of the compound. If thecompound is recognized as beneficial, the energy patternis immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organor gland, but also the associated muscle.”AK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for avariety of conditions.Bone health• neck/low back painand sciatica• whiplash• frozen shoulderJoint health• carpal tunnel syndrome• arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis)• sports injuriesMuscle health• tennis elbow

Examples of treatment meth-ods include special diets, dietary supplements,chiro- practicmanipulation, osteopathic cranial techniques,acupuncture/meridian therapies,acupressure, deep mus-cle massage, and nervous system coordination proce-dures. For example, an AK practitioner might treat asth-ma by looking for weaknesses in specific lower back andleg muscles that share a connection with the adrenalglands. The practitioner will strengthen these musclesand help the adrenal gland produce bronchodilators, chemicals that relax or open air passages in the lungs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 345Applied kinesiologyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 345The practice of kinesiology requires that it be usedin conjunction with other standard diagnostic methods byprofessionals trained in clinical diagnosis. Most practi-tioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, medicaldoctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical thera-pists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, andnurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2% of4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States whoresponded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro-practic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in theirpractice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31%of chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% inNew Zealand use AK.Most practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approachand evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec-tive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal-ing from a structural basis, medical doctors generallyfrom a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo-gists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol-ogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, andin some cases, include a spiritual dimension.The use of AK is often included in insurance cover-age if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost ofthe AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro-practic practices.
Precautions
AK should only by used by trained professionalswith the necessary expertise to perform specific andaccurate tests. The AK examination should be combinedwith a standard physical diagnosis, which often includeslaboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, andother special tests. An AK examination should enhance astandard diagnosis, not replace it. The total diagnosticwork-up should be used to determine the final diagnosis.The use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri-tion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutri-tion sales person as a tool to sell his/her product. The per-son should have the educational background to evaluatenutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowl-edge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques.Side effectsIf AK is performed by a trained practitioner with theappropriate educational background, side effects fromthe muscle-testing procedures should be minimal.
Research and general acceptance
AK is a tool that is used by many health care pro-fessionals, and especially by chiropractors. A literaturereview published in 1999 by researchers from theSchool of Medicine at the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva-tive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that,although AK appears to be a promising methodology,there is a lack of research results relevant to clinicalpractice and outcomes of AK care. They found thislack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti-lization, and changes in symptoms are the importantresults of clinical practice. In addition, they determinedthat some studies that were supposed to be an evalua-tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinicalpractices and principles of AK. However, from studiesadhering to AK principles and employing standardizedtraining by well-trained practitioners, they did statethere was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri-fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud-ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, includingsymptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well-designed studies that account for the individual natureof AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the properclinical context of AK treatment will be informative.Understanding the individual components of theprocess of AK treatment remains important. Studiesaddressing validation of isolated AK procedures needto meet the methodological challenges of studyingappropriate subjects that reflects the current recog-nized practice and understanding of AK. Further evalu-ation of the basic physiologic phenomena involved andcorrelation of AK manual muscle test results will alsoadvance understanding of this diagnostic and therapeu-tic system.”ResourcesBOOKS

Definition
Encephalitisis a serious inflammation of the brain.Arbovirus encephalitis is caused by a virus from theArbovirus group. The term arbovirusstands for Arthro- pod-borne virusbecause these viruses are passed tohumans by members of the phylum Arthropoda (whichincludes insects and spiders).
Description
Of the huge number of arboviruses known to exist,about 80 types are responsible for human disease. Inaddition to the virus, there are usually two other types ofliving creatures involved in the cycle leading to humandisease. When large quantities of virus are present in anarthropod (often a tick or mosquito), the viruses arepassed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropodattempts to feed on the blood of that creature. The virusthrives within the new host, sometimes causing illness,sometimes not. More ticks or mosquitoes are infectedwith the virus when they feed on the host’s blood. Even-tually, a tick or mosquito bites a human, and the virus ispassed along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle onlybetween arthropods and humans, with no intermediatestop in a bird or small mammal.Because the arboviruses require an arthropod to passthem along to humans, the most common times of yearfor these illnesses include summer and fall, when mos-quitoes and ticks are most prevalent. Damp environmentsfavor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus alsoincrease the risk of arbovirus infections.The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis includethe members of the viral families alphavirus (causingEastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis,and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (respon-sible for St. Louis encephalitis,Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis,Russian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan), andbunyavirus (causing California encephalitis).In the United States, the most important types ofarbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephali-tis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louisencephalitis, and California encephalitis. WEE strikesyoung infants in particular, with a 5% chance of death from the illness. Of those who survive, about 60% sufferpermanent brain damage. EEE strikes infants and chil-dren, with a 20% chance of death, and a high rate of per-manent brain damage among survivors. St. Louisencephalitis tends to strike adults older than 40 years ofage, and older patients tend to have higher rates of deathand long-term disability from the infection. Californiavirus primarily strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lowerdegree of permanent brain damage.
Causes and symptoms
Encephalitis occurs because specific arboviruseshave biochemical characteristics which cause them to beparticularly attracted to the cells of the brain and thenerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,with feverand swelling within the brain and nerves. Themembranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (themeninges) may also become inflamed, a condition calledmeningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of bleed-ing occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.Patients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,fever,nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, and sleepiness.As the disease progresses, more severe symptoms devel-op, including tremors, confusion, seizures,coma, and paralysis. Loss of function occurs when specific nerveareas are damaged and/or killed.
Diagnosis
Early in the disease, laboratory testing of blood mayreveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual techniqueused to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injectingthe patient’s blood into the brain of a newborn mouse,then waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitis.Diagnosis is usually based on the patient’s symptoms,history of tick or mosquito bites, and knowledge that thepatient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus.
Treatment
Treatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is direct-ed at improving the symptoms, but does not shorten thecourse of the illness. The main concerns of treatmentinvolve lowering fever, treating pain, avoiding dehydra- tionor other chemical imbalances, and decreasingswelling in the brain with steroids.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the particular type ofarbovirus causing disease, and on the age and priorhealth status of the patient. Death rates range all the wayup to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates oflifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for sometypes of arboviruses.
Prevention
Prevention involves avoiding contact with arthro-pods which carry these viruses. This means wearing
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 347Arbovirus encephalitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 347appropriate insect repellents, and dressing properly inareas known to be infested. Insecticides and the avoid-ance of collections of standing water (which are goodbreeding ground for arthropods) is also effective atdecreasing arthropod populations.There are immunizations available against EEE andWEE. These have primarily been used to safeguard labo-ratory workers who have regular exposure to these viruses.Resources

Description
OriginsAromatic plants have been employed for their heal-ing, preservative, and pleasurable qualities throughoutrecorded history in both the East and West. As early as1500 
B.C. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils,incense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals fortheir religious ceremonies.There is evidence that the Chinese may have recog-nized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies muchearlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, ShenNung’s Pen Ts’ao(c. 2700-3000 
B.C.) catalogs over 200botanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indianmedicine that dates back over 2,500 years, also used aro-matic herbs for treatment.The Romans were well-known for their use of fra-grances. They bathed with botanicals and integratedthem into their state and religious rituals. So did theGreeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal prop-erties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeonPedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text De Materia Medica(60 
A.D.) was the standard textbook forWestern medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively onthe medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The Medica contained detailed information on over 500 plants and4,740 separate medicinal uses for them, including anentire section on aromatics.Written records of herbal distillation are found as earlyas the first century 
A.D., and around 1000 A.D., the notedArab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distil-lation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medicinal prop-erties of essential oils in his writings. However, it wasn’tuntil 1937, when French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossépublished Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hor-mones végé tales, that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, wasintroduced in Europe as a medical discipline. Gattefossé,who was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered thehealing properties of lavender oil quite by accident whenhe suffered a severe burn while working and used the clos-est available liquid, lavender oil, to soak it in.In the late 20th century, French physician Jean Valnetused botanical aromatics as a front line treatment forwounded soldiers in World War II. He wrote about his use
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 348AromatherapyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 348of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic properties,in his 1964 book Aromatherapie, traitement des maladiespar les essences des plantes, which popularized the use ofessential oils for medical and psychiatric treatment through-out France. Later, French biochemist Mauguerite Maurypopularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils, and in1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English languagebook on the subject,The Art of Aromatherapy, which intro-duced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy andsparked its popularity in the United Kingdom.In aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully selectedfor their medicinal properties. As essential oils areabsorbed into the bloodstream through application to theskin or inhalation, their active components trigger certainpharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief).In addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy hasstrong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil, orthe speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought tobe linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil. Asa rule of thumb, oils that evaporate quickly are consid-ered emotionally uplifting, while slowly-evaporating oilsare thought to have a calming effect.Essential oils commonly used in aromatherapy treat-ment include:• Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobilis). An anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Useful in treating otitis media(earache), skin conditions, menstrual pains, anddepression.• Clary sage (Salvia sclarea). This natural astringent isnot only used to treat oily hair and skin, but is also saidto be useful in regulating the menstrual cycle, improv-ing mood, and controlling high blood pressure. Clarysage should not be used by pregnant women.• Lavender (Lavandula officinalis). A popular aromather-apy oil which mixes well with most essential oils,lavender has a wide range of medicinal and cosmeticapplications, including treatment of insect bites, burns, respiratory infections, intestinal discomfort, nausea,migraine,insomnia, depression, and stress.• Myrtle (Myrtus communis). Myrtle is a fungicide, dis-infectant, and antibacterial. It is often used in steamaromatherapy treatments to alleviate the symptoms ofwhooping cough,bronchitis, and other respiratoryinfections.• Neroli (bitter orange), (Citrus aurantium). Citrus oilextracted from bitter orange flower and peel and used totreat sore throat, insomnia, and stress and anxiety-related conditions.• Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). An essential oil used totreat stomach complaints and known for its reportedability to lift the mood while relieving stress.• Peppermint (Mentha piperita). Relaxes and soothes thestomach muscles and gastrointestinal tract. Pepper-mint’s actions as an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, andantimicrobial also make it an effective skin treatment,and useful in fighting cold and flu symptoms.• Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Stimulating essen-tial oil used to treat muscular and rheumatic com-plaints, as well as low blood pressure, gastrointestinalproblems, and headaches.• Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia). Has bactericidal,virucidal, fungicidal, and anti-inflammatory propertiesthat make it a good choice for fighting infection. Rec-ommended for treating sore throat and respiratoryinfections, vaginal and bladder infections, wounds, anda variety of skin conditions.• Ylang ylang (Cananga odorata). A sedative essential oilsometimes used to treat hypertensionand tachycardia.Essential oils contain active agents that can havepotent physical effects. While some basic aromatherapyhome treatments can be self-administered, medical aro-matherapy should always be performed under the guid-ance of an aromatherapist, herbalist, massage therapist,nurse, or physician.InhalationThe most basic method of administering aromather-apy is direct or indirect inhalation of essential oils. Sev-eral drops of an essential oil can be applied to a tissue or

As a holistic therapy, aromatherapy is believed to benefitboth the mind and body. Here, the aromatic substancesfrom a flower stimulates the olfactory bulb and neurons.Thedesired emotional response (such as relaxation) is activat-ed from the limbic system of the brain.

A small amount ofessential oil can also be added to a bowl of hot water andused as a steam treatment. This technique is recommend-ed when aromatherapy is used to treat respiratory and/orskin conditions. Aromatherapy steam devices are alsoavailable commercially. A warm bath containing essen-tial oils can have the same effect as steam aromatherapy,with the added benefit of promoting relaxation. Whenused in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather than hotto slow the evaporation of the oil.Essential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulbrings can be used to disperse essential oils over a largearea. These devices can be particularly effective in aro-matherapy that uses essential oils to promote a healthierhome environment. For example, eucalyptus and tea treeoil are known for their antiseptic qualities and are fre-quently used to disinfect sickrooms, and citronella andgeranium can be useful in repelling insects.Direct applicationBecause of their potency, essential oils are diluted ina carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the skin toprevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil can be avegetable or olive based one, such as wheat germ or avo-cado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet almond, grape-seed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach kernel, may beabsorbed more easily by the skin. Standard dilutions ofessential oils in carrier oils range from 2–10%. However,some oils can be used at higher concentrations, and oth-ers should be diluted further for safe and effective use.The type of carrier oil used and the therapeutic use of theapplication may also influence how the essential oil ismixed. Individuals should seek guidance from a health-care professional and/or aromatherapist when dilutingessential oils.Massage is a common therapeutic technique used inconjunction with aromatherapy to both relax the bodyand thoroughly administer the essential oil treatment.Essential oils can also be used in hot or cold compressesand soaks to treat muscle aches and pains (e.g., lavenderand ginger). As a sore throat remedy, antiseptic andsoothing essential oils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can bethoroughly mixed with water and used as a gargle ormouthwash.Internal useSome essential oils can be administered internally intincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat certainsymptoms or conditions; however, this treatment shouldnever be self-administered. Essential oils should only betaken internally under the supervision of a qualifiedhealthcare professional.As non-prescription botanical preparations, theessential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not paidfor by health insurance. The self-administered nature ofthe therapy controls costs to some degree. Aromatherapytreatment sessions from a professional aromatherapistare not covered by health insurance in most cases,although aromatherapy performed in conjunction withphysical therapy, nursing, therapeutic massage, or othercovered medical services may be. Individuals shouldcheck with their insurance provider to find out abouttheir specific coverage.The adage “You get what you pay for” usuallyapplies when purchasing essential oils, as bargain oils are

Pure essential oilscan be expensive; and the cost of an oil will vary depend-ing on its quality and availability.
Preparations
The method of extracting an essential oil varies byplant type. Common methods include water or steam dis-tillation and cold pressing. Quality essential oils shouldbe unadulterated and extracted from pure botanicals.Many aromatherapy oils on the market are syntheticand/or diluted, contain solvents, or are extracted frombotanicals grown with pesticides or herbicides. To ensurebest results, essential oils should be made from pureorganic botanicals and labeled by their full botanicalname. Oils should always be stored dark bottles out ofdirect light.Before using essential oils on the skin, individualsshould perform a skin patch test by applying a smallamount of the diluted oil behind the wrist and covering itwith a bandage or cloth for up to 12 hours. If redness orirritation occurs, the oil should be diluted further and asecond skin test performed, or it should be avoided alto-gether. Individuals should never apply undiluted essen-tial oils to the skin unless advised to do so by a trainedhealthcare professional.

Side effects
Side effects vary by the type of essential oil used.Citrus-based essential oils can cause heightened sensitivi-ty to sunlight. Essential oils may also cause contact der-matitis, an allergic reaction characterized by redness andirritation. Anyone experiencing an allergic reaction to anessential oil should discontinue its use and contact theirhealthcare professional for further guidance. Individualsshould do a small skin patch test with new essential oilsbefore using them extensively (see “Preparations” above).
Research and general acceptance
The antiseptic and bactericidal qualities of someessential oils (such as tea tree and peppermint) and theirvalue in fighting infection has been detailed extensivelyin both ancient and modern medical literature.Recent research in mainstream medical literaturehas also shown that aromatherapy has a positive psycho-logical impact on patients, as well. Several clinical stud-ies involving both post-operative and chronically ill sub-jects showed that massage with essential oils can behelpful in improving emotional well-being, and conse-quently, promoting the healing process.Today, the use of holistic aromatherapy is widelyaccepted in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, whereit is commonly used in conjunction with massage as botha psychological and physiological healing tool. In theUnited States, where aromatherapy is often misunder-stood as solely a cosmetic treatment, the mainstreammedical community has been slower to accept it.Resources

Paula Ford-MartinArrhythmias
Definition
An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the heart’s rhythm,or heartbeat pattern. The heartbeat can be too slow, too fast,have extra beats, skip a beat, or otherwise beat irregularly.
Description
Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadenceof the heartbeat, which cause the heart to pump improp-erly. The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium,where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus node)sends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to theatrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node thensends signals into the main pumping chamber to makethe ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heart-beat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node,an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, ora heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signalfrom traveling down the normal pathway.More than four million Americans have arrhythmias,most of which are harmless. Middle-aged adults common-ly experience arrhythmias. As people age, the probabilityof experiencing an arrhythmia increases. Arrhythmiasoften occur in people who do not have heart disease. Inpeople with heart disease, it is usually the heart diseasewhich is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias oftenoccur during and after heart attacks. Some types ofarrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, are seriousand even life threatening. In the United States, arrhythmiasare the primary cause of sudden cardiac death, account- ing for more than 350,000 deaths each year.Slow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) arecalled bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than 100beats per minute) are called tachycardias. Bradycardiacan result in poor circulation of blood, and, hence, a lackof oxygen throughout the body, especially the brain.Tachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability topump effectively because the ventricles do not haveenough time to completely fill.Arrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin:the atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular arrhythmiasoccur in the upper areas of the heart and are less seriousthan ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillationis the most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medicalhelp is immediate.
Causes and symptoms
In many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia isunknown. Known causes of arrhythmias include heart
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 352ArrhythmiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 352disease,stress,caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet pills, anddecongestantsin coughand cold medicines.Symptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heartbeat,pounding or fluttering chest sensations, skipping a heart-beat, “flip-flops,”dizziness, faintness,shortness ofbreath, and chest pains.
Diagnosis
Examination with a stethoscope, electrocardio-grams, and electrophysiologic studies is used to diagnosearrhythmias. Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified bylistening to the patient’s heart through a stethoscope, but,since arrhythmias are not always present, they may notoccur during the physical exam.An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’sactivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circu-lation (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conductingjelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.They send impulses of the heart’s activity through anelectrical activity monitor (oscilloscope) to a recorderthat traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 min-utes and is performed in a physician’s office. Anothertype of ECG, commonly known as the exercisestresstest, measures how the heart and blood vessels respondto exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmillor a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physi-cian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30minutes. Other types of ECGs include 24-hour ECGmonitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hourECG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small,portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chestthat record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.Transtelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias thatoccur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoring can continue for days orweeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via tele-phone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt,or the patient can store the information in the recorderand transmit it later.Electrophysiologic studies are invasive proceduresperformed in a hospital to identify the origin of seriousarrhythmias and responses to various treatments. Theyinvolve cardiac catheterization, in which catheterstipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the armor leg through the blood vessels into the heart. The elec-trodes record impulses in the heart, highlighting wherethe arrhythmia starts. During the procedure, physicianscan test the effects of various drugs by provoking anarrhythmia through the electrodes and trying differentdrugs. The procedure takes one to three hours, duringwhich the patient is awake but mildly sedated. Localanesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sites.Treatment
Many arrhythmias do not require any treatment. Forserious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart diseasesometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some cases, thearrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock ( car- dioversion), automatic implantable defibrillators, artificialpacemakers,catheter ablation, or surgery. Supraventricu-lar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy. Ven-tricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat.Drug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, butfinding the right drug and dose requires care and can takesome time. Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmiasinclude beta-blockers,calcium channel blockers, quini- dine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Becauseof their potential serious side effects, stronger, desensi-tizing drugs are used only to treat life-threateningarrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmiashave possible side effects, ranging from mild complica-tions with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers tomore serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, para-doxically, cause arrhythmias or make them worse.Response to drugs is usually measured by ECG, Holtermonitor, or electrophysiologic study.In emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrilla-tion(the application of an electrical shock to the chestwall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart to its nor-mal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to preventrecurrence of the arrhythmia.Artificial pacemakers that send electrical signals tomake the heart beat properly can be implanted under theskin during a simple operation. Leads from the pacemak-er are anchored to the right side of the heart. Pacemakersare used to correct bradycardia and are sometimes usedafter surgical or catheter ablation.Automatic implantable defibrillators correct life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing themand then restoring a normal heart rhythm by pacing theheart or giving it an electric shock. They are implantedwithin the chest wall without major surgery and storeinformation for future evaluation by physicians. Auto-matic implantable defibrillators have proven to be moreeffective in saving lives than drugs alone. They often areused in conjunction with drug therapy.Ablation, a procedure to alter or remove the hearttissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recur-rence, can be performed through a catheter or surgery.Supraventricular tachycardia can be treated successfullywith ablation. Catheter ablation is performed in acatheterization laboratory with the patient under seda- tion. A catheter equipped with a device that maps theheart’s electrical pathways is inserted into a vein and is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 353ArrhythmiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 353threaded into the heart. High-frequency radio waves arethen used to remove the pathway(s) causing the arrhyth-mia. Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is per-formed in a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radiowaves to destroy tissue. Ablation treatments are usedwhen medications fail.Maze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by makingmultiple incisions through the atrium to allow electricalimpulses to move effectively. This is often recommendedfor patients who have not responded to drugs or car-dioversion.
Alternative treatment
Since some arrhythmias can be life threatening, aconventional medical doctor should always be consultedfirst. Acupuncturecan correct an insignificant number(1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new, minor arrhyth-mias, acupuncture may be effective in up to 70% of cases,but this figure may not differ much from placebo therapy.Both western and Chinese herbal remedies are also usedin the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn ( Cratae- gus laevigata) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates theheart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It isgentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove(Digitalis purpurea), an herb whose action on the heart istoo potent for use without supervision by a qualified prac-titioner. Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe reme-dies such as Lachesisand aconite or monkshood (Aconi- tum napellus) to treat mild arrhythmias.
Prognosis
Advances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs, andmedical technology have extended the lives of manypatients with serious arrhythmias. Diagnostic techniquesenable physicians to accurately identify arrhythmias,while new drugs, advances in pacemaker technology, thedevelopment of implantable defibrillators, and progressin ablative techniques offer effective treatments for manytypes of arrhythmia.
Prevention
Some arrhythmias can be prevented by managingstress, controlling anxiety, and avoiding caffeine, alco-hol, decongestants,cocaine, and cigarettes.Resources

Arterial embolism
Definition
An embolus is a blood clot, bit of tissue or tumor,gas bubble, or other foreign body that circulates in theblood stream until it becomes stuck in a blood vessel.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 354Arterial embolismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 354Description
When a blood clot develops in an artery and remainsin place, it is called a thrombosis. If all or part of theblockage breaks away and lodges in another part of theartery, it is called an embolism. Blockage of an artery inthis manner can be the result of a blood clot, fat cells, oran air bubble.When an embolus blocks the flow of blood in anartery, the tissues beyond the plug are deprived of normalblood flow and oxygen. This can cause severe damageand even deathof the tissues involved.Emboli can affect any part of the body. The mostcommon sites are the legs and feet. When the brain isaffected, it is called a stroke. When the heart is involved,it is called a heart attackor myocardial infarction (MI).
Causes and symptoms
A common cause of embolus is when an arterywhose lining has become thickened or damaged, usuallywith age, allows cholesterol to build up more easily thannormal on the artery wall. If some of the cholesterolbreaks off, it forms an embolus. Emboli also commonlyform from blood clots in a heart that has been damagedfrom heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormallyfrom arterial fibrillation.Other known causes are fat cells that enter the bloodafter a major bone fracture, infected blood cells, cancer cells that enter the blood stream, and small gas bubbles.Symptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or buildslowly over time, depending on the amount of blockedblood flow.If the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be mus-cle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color, lowertemperature in the limb, and weakness or loss of musclefunction. If it occurs in an internal organ, there is usuallypain and/or loss of the organ’s function.
Diagnosis
The following tests can be used to confirm the pres-ence of an arterial embolism:• Electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG or ECG. Forthis test, patches that detect electrical impulses from theheart are attached to the chest and extremities. The infor-mation is displayed on a monitor screen or a paper tapein the form of waves. Reduced blood and oxygen supplyto the heart shows as a change in the shape of the waves.• Noninvasive vascular tests. These involve measuringblood pressure in various parts of the body and compar-ing the results from each location. When there is aKEY TERMS
Arterial fibrillation—An arrhythmia; chaotic quiv-ering of the arteries.Thrombosis—A blockage in a blood vessel thatbuilds and remains in one place.decrease in blood pressure beyond what is normalbetween two points, a blockage is presumed to be present.•Angiography. In this procedure, a colored liquid mate-rial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be seen with xrays is injected into the blood stream through a smalltube called a catheter. As the dye fills the arteries, theyare easily seen on x ray motion pictures. If there is ablockage in the artery, it shows up as a sudden cut off inthe movement of contrast material. Angiography is anexpensive procedure and does carry some risk. Thecatheter may cause a blood clot to form, blocking bloodflow. There is also the risk of poking the catheterthrough the artery or heart muscle. Some people maybe allergic to the dye. The risk of any of these injuriesoccurring is small.
Treatment
Arterial embolism can be treated with medication orsurgery, depending on the extent and location of theblockage.Medication to dissolve the clot is usually giventhrough a catheter directly into the affected artery. If theembolus was caused by a blood clot, medications thatthin the blood will help reduce the risk of anotherembolism.A surgeon can remove an embolus by making anincision in the artery above the blockage and, using acatheter inserted past the embolus, drag it out through theincision.If the condition is severe, a surgeon may elect tobypass the blocked vessel by grafting a new vessel in itsplace.
Prognosis
An arterial embolism is serious and should be treat-ed promptly to avoid permanent damage to the affectedarea. The outcome of any treatment depends on the loca-tion and seriousness of the embolism. New arterialemboli can form even after successful treatment of thefirst event.

Arteriovenous fistula
Definition
An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal channel orpassage between an artery and a vein.
Description
An arteriovenous fistula is a disruption of the normalblood flow pattern. Normally, oxygenated blood flows tothe tissue through arteries and capillaries. Following therelease of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to theheart in veins. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal con-nection of an artery and a vein. The blood bypasses the cap-illaries and tissues, and returns to the heart. Arterial bloodhas a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swellingof veins involved in a fistula. Although both the artery andthe vein retain their normal connections, the new openingbetween the two will cause some arterial blood to shuntinto the vein because of the blood pressure difference.
Causes and symptoms
There are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congen-ital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is onethat formed during fetal development. It is a birth defect.KEY TERMS
Congenital—Present at the time of birth.In congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the lower extremityare more frequently involved than other areas of the body.Congenital fistulas are not common. An acquired arteri-ovenous fistula is one that develops after a person is born.It usually occurs when an artery and vein that are side-by-side are damaged and the healing process results in thetwo becoming linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenousfistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial punc-ture in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparentcause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physiciansperform surgery to create a fistula. These patients receivemany needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysismachines and for routine blood analysis testing. The veinsused may scar and become difficult to use. Surgery is usedto connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressureand flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance ofblood clots forming inside the vein.The main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas nearthe surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veins.In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken forvaricose veins. Other fistulas can cause more seriousproblems depending on their location and the blood ves-sels involved.
Diagnosis
Using a stethoscope, a physician can detect thesound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound isa distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can betracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.
Treatment
Small arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected bysurgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult totreat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injectiontherapy may be used. Injection therapy is the injection ofsubstances that cause the blood to clot at the site of theinjection. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, theblood clot should stop the passage of blood from theartery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to correctacquired fistulas once they are diagnosed.Resources

Arteriovenous malformations
Definition
Arteriovenous malformations are blood vesseldefects that occur before birth when the fetus is growingin the uterus (prenatal development). The blood vesselsappear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins. They donot possess the capillary (very fine blood vessels) bedwhich normally exists in the common area where thearteries and veins lie in close proximity (artery-veininterface). An arteriovenous malformation (A VM) mayhemorrhage, or bleed, leading to serious complicationsthat can be life-threatening.
Description
A VMs represent an abnormal interface betweenarteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenatedblood to the body’s tissues through progressively smallerblood vessels. The smallest are capillaries, which form aweb of blood vessels (the capillary bed) through thebody’s tissues. The arterial blood moves through tissuesby these tiny pathways, exchanging its load of oxygenand nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste productsproduced by the body cells (cellular wastes). The blood iscarried away by progressively larger blood vessels, theveins. A VMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood ismoved (shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.A VMs can occur anywhere in the body and have beenfound in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart, liver, andkidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are locat-ed in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Owing to thepossibility of hemorrhaging, such A VMs carry the risk ofstroke,paralysis, and the loss of speech, memory, orvision. An A VM that hemorrhages can be fatal.Approximately three of every 100,000 people have acerebral A VM and roughly 40-80% of them will experi-ence some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels atsome point. The annual risk of an A VM bleeding is esti-mated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the risk of bleedingdecreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intensephysical activity do not seem to be associated with A VMhemorrhage, but pregnancyand labor could cause a rup-ture or breaking open of a blood vessel. An A VM hemor-rhage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture. (Ananeurysm is a swollen, blood filled vessel where thepressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outward.)There is an approximate 10% fatality rate associated withA VM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate forruptured aneurysms.Although A VMs are congenital defects, meaning aperson is born with them, they are rarely discoveredbefore age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for someA VMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. Themajority of A VMs are discovered in people age 20-40.Medical researchers estimate that the malformations arecreated during days 45-60 of fetal development. A sec-ond theory suggests that A VMs are primitive structuresthat are left over from the period when fetal blood circu-lating systems began to develop.However they form, A VMs have blood vessels thatare abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed into themalformation are unusually swollen and thin walled.They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue andelastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These blood vesselscommonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts andhyalin. The venous part of the malformation receivesblood directly from the artery. Without the interveningcapillary bed, the veins receive blood at a higher pressurethan they were designed to handle. This part of the mal-formation is also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. Thereis a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near anA VM, increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain dam-age, and death. Approximately 10-15% of A VMs areaccompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysmthat looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall ofthe blood vessel.

Arteriovenous malformations.(Custom Medical Stock Photo.Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 357Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries,there is often an abnormal proliferation of capillariesnext to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the mal-formation, causing it to grow larger in some cases. As theA VM receives more blood through this “steal,” adjacentbrain tissue does not receive enough. These areas showabnormal nerve cell growth, cell death, and deposits ofcalcium in that area (calcification). Nerve cells within themalformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and arebelieved to be nonfunctional.
Causes and symptoms
Most people do not realize that they have an A VMunless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms.Small A VMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a hemor-rhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache. The headache may be focused in one specific area or itmay be more general. It can be mistaken for a migrainein some cases. The headache is accompanied by othersymptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff neck, sleepiness,lethargy, confusion, irritability, or weakness anywhere inthe body. Seizures occur in about a quarter of A VMcases. A person may experience decreased, double, orblurred vision. Hemorrhaging from an A VM is generallyless dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm,with a survival rate of 80-90%.Other symptoms occur less frequently, but some-times appear alongside major symptoms such as the sud-den severe headache. Additional warning signs of ableeding A VM are impaired speech or smell, fainting, facial paralysis, a drooping eyelid,dizziness, and ringingor buzzing in the ears.Although large A VMs are less likely to hemorrhage,they can induce symptoms based on their mass alone.Large A VMs exert pressure against brain tissue, causeabnormal development in the surrounding brain tissue,and slow down or block blood flow. Hydrocephalus,a swelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluids,may develop. The warning signs associated with a largenon-bleeding A VM are similar to the symptoms of asmall malformation that is bleeding. Unexplainedheadaches, seizures, dizziness, and neurological symp-toms, such as sensory changes, are signals that demandmedical attention.
Diagnosis
Based on the clinical symptoms such as severeheadache and neurological problems, and after a com-plete neurologic exam, a computed tomography scan(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a whoosh-ing sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jaw(called a bruit), can be heard with a stethoscope. The CTscan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in thebrain and can identify A VMs larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is also used toidentify an A VM. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, mayfollow the MRI or CT scan. A lumbar puncture involvesremoving a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from thelower part of the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdownproducts in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding.To pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a cere-bral angiographyis done. This procedure uses x rays tomap out the blood vessels in the brain, including the ves-sels that feed into the malformation. The informationgained from angiography complements the MRI andhelps distinguish the precise location of the A VM.Treatment
Neurosurgeons consider several factors beforedeciding on a treatment option. There is some debateover whether or not to treat A VMs that have not rup-tured and are not causing any symptoms. The risks andbenefits of proceeding with treatment need to be mea-sured on an individual basis, taking into account factorssuch as the person’s age and general health, as well asthe A VM’s size and location. Several treatment optionsare available, both for symptomatic or asymptomaticA VMs. These treatment options may be used alone or incombination.SurgeryRemoving the A VM is the surest way of preventingit from causing future problems. Both small and largeA VMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommend-ed for superficial A VMs, but may be too dangerous fordeep or very large A VMs. Unless it is an emergency situ-ation, an A VM that has hemorrhaged is treated conserva-tively for several weeks. Conservative treatment consistsof managing the immediate symptoms and allowing thepatient’s condition to stabilize. Surgery requires generalanesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than anyother treatment option.RadiationRadiation is particularly useful to treat small (under1 in) malformations that are deep within the brain. Ioniz-ing radiation is directed at the malformation, destroyingthe A VM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radi-ation treatment is accomplished in a single session and itis not necessary to open the skull. However, success canonly be measured over the course of the following twoyears. A year after the procedure, 50-75% of treatedA VMs are completely blocked; two years after radiationtreatment, the percentage increases to 85-95%.

This technique does not require opening theskull to expose the brain and can be used to treat deepA VMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a catheter isthreaded through the artery in the thigh (femoral artery) tothe affected area. The patient remains awake during theprocedure and medications can be administered to pre-vent discomfort. The blood vessel leading into the A VMis assessed for its importance to the rest of the brainbefore a balloon or other blocking agent is inserted via thecatheter. The block chokes off the blood supply to themalformation. There may be a mild headache or nauseaassociated with the procedure, but patients may resumenormal activities after leaving the hospital. At least two tothree embolization procedures are usually necessary atintervals of two to six weeks. At least a three-day hospitalstay is associated with each embolization.
Prognosis
Approximately 10% of A VM cases are fatal. Seizuresand neurological changes may be permanent in another10-30% cases of A VM rupture. If an A VM bleeds once, itis about 20% likely to bleed again in the next year. Astime passes from the initial hemorrhage, the risk for fur-ther bleeding drops to about 3-4%. If the A VM has notbled, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that it never will.Untreated A VMs can grow larger over time and rarely goaway by themselves. Once an A VM is removed and a per-KEY TERMS

Arthrography
Definition
Arthrograpy is a procedure involving multiple x rays ofa joint using a fluoroscope, or a special piece of x-ray equip-ment which shows an immediate x-ray image. A contrastmedium (in this case, a contrast iodine solution) injectedinto the joint area helps highlight structures of the joint.
Purpose
Frequently, arthrography is ordered to determine thecause of unexplained joint pain. This fluoroscopic proce-dure can show the internal workings of specific jointsand outline soft tissue structures. The procedure mayalso be conducted to identify problems with the liga-ments, cartilage, tendons, or the joint capsule of the hip,shoulder, knee, ankle or wrist. An arthrography proce-dure may locate cysts in the joint area, evaluate problemswith the joint’s arrangement and function, or indicate the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 359ArthrographyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 359need for joint replacement(prostheses). The most com-monly studied joints are the knee and shoulder.
Precautions
Patients who are pregnant or may be pregnantshould not have this procedure unless the benefits of thefindings outweigh the risk of radiation exposure. Patientswho are known to be allergic to iodine need to discussthis complication with their physician. Patients who havea known allergy to shellfish are more likely to be allergicto iodine contrast.
Description
Arthrograpy may be referred to as “joint radiography”or “x rays of the joint.” The term arthrogram may be usedinterchangeably with arthrography. The joint area will becleaned and a local anesthetic will be injected into the tis-sues around the joint to reduce pain. Next, if fluids are pre-sent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-rate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato-ry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected intothe joint through the same location by attaching the aspi-rating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium.The purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is tohelp highlight details of areas under study by making themopaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air andwater-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine.Air and iodine may be used together or independently.After the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec-tion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to movethe joint around to distribute the contrast.Before the contrast medium can be absorbed by thejoint itself, several films will be quickly taken under theguidance of the fluoroscope. The patient will be asked tomove the joint into a series of positions, keeping stillbetween positioning. Sometimes, the patient will experiencesome tingling or discomfort during the procedure, which isnormal and due to the contrast. Following fluoroscopictracking of the contrast, standard x rays of the area may alsobe taken. The entire procedure will last about one hour.Preparation
It is important to discuss any known sensitivity tolocal anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. Aphysician should explain the procedure and the risksassociated with contrast agents and ask the patient to signan informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis-tered, the patient may be instructed not to eat before theexam. The timeframe of fastingmay extend from only90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night before.There is no other preparation necessary.
Aftercare
The affected joint should be rested for approximate-ly 12 hours following the procedure. The joint may bewrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient shouldreceive instructions on the care and changing of the ban-dage. Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking arenormal for a few days following arthrography. Thesenoises are the result of liquid in the joints. Swelling mayalso occur and can be treated with application of ice orcold packs. A mild pain reliever can be used to lessenpain in the first few days. However, if any of these symp-toms persist for more than a few days, patients areadvised to contact their physician.
Risks
In some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions,ranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular ornervous system complications. Since the contrast dye isput into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactionsare rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast examsshould meet requirements for equipment, supplies andstaff training to handle a possible severe reaction. Infec-tion or joint damage are possible, although not frequent,complications of arthrography.
Normal results
A normal arthrography exam will show properplacement of the dye or contrast medium throughout thejoint structures, joint space, cartilage and ligaments.
Abnormal results
The abnormal placement of dye may indicaterheumatoid arthritis, cysts, joint dislocation, rupture of

The entire lining of the joint becomes opaque fromthe technique, which allows the radiologist to see abnor-malities in the intricate workings of the joint.

Patients with hip pros-theses may receive arthrography to evaluate properplacement or function of their prostheses.Resources

Arthroplasty
Definition
Arthroplasty is surgery to relieve painand restorerange of motion by realigning or reconstructing a joint.KEY TERMS
Aspirate—Remove fluids by suction, often througha needle.Contrast (agent, medium)—A substance injectedinto the body that illuminates certain structuresthat would otherwise be hard to see on the radi-ograph(film).Fluoroscope—A device used in some radiologyprocedures that provides immediate images andmotion on a screen much like those seen at airportbaggage security stations.Radiologist—A medical doctor specially trained inradiology (x ray) interpretation and its use in thediagnosis of diseases and injuries.X ray—A form of electromagnetic radiation withshorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays canpenetrate most structures.Purpose
The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of astiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of arthroplasticsurgery exist. Joint resection involves removing a portionof the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap betweenthe bone and the socket, to improve the range of motion.Scar tissue eventually fills the gap. Pain is relieved andmotion is restored, but the joint is less stable.Interpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshapethe joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bonesforming the joint. The prosthesis can be made of plasticand metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skin.When interpositional reconstruction fails, total joint replacementmay be necessary. Joint replacement is alsocalled total joint arthroplasty.In recent years, joint replacement has become the oper-ation of choice for most knee and hip problems. Elbow,shoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more likely to be treat-ed with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.Arthroplasty is performed on people suffering fromsevere pain and disabling joint stiffness that result fromosteoarthritisor rheumatoid arthritis. Joint resection,rather than joint replacement, is more likely to be per-formed on people with rheumatoid arthritis, especiallywhen the elbow joint is involved. Total joint replacementis usually reserved for people over the age of 60.
Precautions
If both the bone and socket of a joint are damaged,joint replacement is usually the preferred treatment.
Description
Arthroplasty is performed under general or regionalanesthesia in a hospital, by an orthopedic surgeon. Cer-tain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and tendto have higher success rates than less specialized centers.In joint resection, the surgeon makes an incision atthe joint, then carefully removes minimum amount ofbone necessary to allow free motion. The more bone thatremains, the more stable the joint. Ligament attachmentsare preserved as much as possible. In interpositionalreconstruction, both bones of the joint are reshaped, anda disk of material is placed between the bones to preventtheir rubbing together. Length of hospital stay dependson which joint is treated, but is normally only a few days.
Preparation
Prior to arthroplasty, all the standard preoperativeblood and urine tests are performed. The patient meets
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 361ArthroplastyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 361with the anesthesiologist to discuss any special condi-tions that affect the administration of anesthesia.
Aftercare
Patients who have undergone arthroplasty must becareful not to over stressor destabilize the joint. Physicaltherapy is begun immediately. Antibioticsare given toprevent infection.
Risks
Joint resection and interpositional reconstruction donot always produce successful results, especially inpatients with rheumatoid arthritis. Repeat surgery or totaljoint replacement may be necessary. As with any majorsurgery, there is always a risk of an allergic reaction toanesthesia or that blood clots will break loose andobstruct the arteries.
Normal results
Most patients recover with improved range ofmotion in the joint and relief from pain.Resources

Arthroscopic surgery
Definition
Arthroscopic surgery is a procedure to visualize,diagnose, and treat joint problems. The name is derivedKEY TERMS
Fascia—Thin connective tissue covering or sepa-rating the muscles and internal organs of the body.Rheumatoid arthritis—A joint disease of unknownorigins that may begin at an early age, causingdeformity and loss of function in the joints.from the Greek words arthron,which means joint,and skopein,which means to look at.Purpose
Arthroscopic surgery is used to identify, monitor,and diagnose joint injuries and disease; or to removebone or cartilage or repair tendons or ligaments. Diag-nostic arthroscopic surgery is performed when medicalhistory, physical exam, x rays, and other tests such asMRIs or CTs don’t provide a definitive diagnosis.
Precautions
Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery should not be per-formed unless conservative treatment does not fix theproblem.
Description
In arthroscopic surgery, an orthopedic surgeon usesan arthroscope, a fiber-optic instrument, to see the insideof a joint. After making an incision about the size of abuttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile sodium chloridesolution is injected to distend the joint. The arthroscope,an instrument the size of a pencil, is then inserted into thejoint. The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting systemthrough which the structures inside the joint are transmit-ted to a miniature television camera attached to the endof the arthroscope. The surgeon uses irrigation and suc-tion to remove blood and debris from the joint beforeexamining it. Other incisions may be made in order tosee other parts of the joint or to insert additional instru-ments. Looking at the interior of the joint on the televi-sion screen, the surgeon can then determine the amountor type of injury and, if necessary, take a biopsy speci-men or repair or correct the problem. Arthroscopicsurgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilageand treat minor tears and other disorders. When the pro-cedure is finished, the arthroscope is removed and thejoint is irrigated. The site of the incision is bandaged.Arthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treatjoint problems, most commonly in the knee, but also in theshoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and hip. Some of the mostcommon joint problems seen with an arthroscope are:• inflammation in the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or ankle• injuries to the shoulder (rotator cuff tendon tears,impingement syndrome, and recurrent dislocations),knee (cartilage tears, wearing down of or injury to thecartilage cushion, and anterior cruciate ligament tearswith instability), and wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) • loose bodies of bone and/or cartilage in the knee, shoul-der, elbow, ankle, or wrist
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 362Arthroscopic surgeryGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 362Corrective arthroscopic surgery is performed withinstruments that are inserted through additional inci-sions. Arthritis can sometimes be treated with arthro-scopic surgery. Some problems are treated with a combi-nation of arthroscopic and standard surgery.Also called arthroscopy, the procedure is per-formed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility. Thetype of anesthesia (local, spinal, or general) and thelength of the procedure depends on the joint operated onand the complexity of the suspected problem. Arthro-scopic surgery rarely takes more than an hour. Mostpatients who have arthroscopic surgery are released thatsame day; some patients stay in the hospital overnight.Considered the most important orthopedic develop-ment in the 20th century, arthroscopic surgery is widelyused. The use of arthroscopic surgery on famous athleteshas been well publicized. It is estimated that 80% oforthopedic surgeons practice arthroscopic surgery.Arthroscopic surgery was initially a diagnostic tool usedprior to open surgery, but as better instruments and tech-niques were developed, it began to be used to actuallytreat a variety of joint problems. New techniques current-ly under development are likely to lead to other jointsbeing treated with arthroscopic surgery in the future.Recently, lasers were introduced in arthroscopic surgeryand other new energy sources are being explored. Lasersand electromagnetic radiation can repair rather than resectinjuries and may be more cost effective than instruments.
Preparation
Before the procedure, blood and urine studies and xrays of the joint will be conducted.
Aftercare
Immediately after the procedure, the patient willspend several hours in the recovery room. An ice packwill be put on the joint that was operated on for up to 48hours after the procedure. Painmedicine, prescription ornon-prescription, will be given. The morning after thesurgery, the dressing can be removed and replaced byadhesive strips. The patient should call his/her doctorupon experiencing an increase in pain, swelling, redness,drainage or bleeding at the site of the surgery, signs ofinfection (headache, muscle aches,dizziness,fever), or nausea or vomiting.

Arthroscopy
Definition
Arthroscopy is the examination of a joint, specifical-ly, the inside structures. The procedure is performed byinserting a specifically designed illuminated device intothe joint through a small incision. This instrument iscalled an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy isprimarily associated with the process of diagnosis. How-ever, when actual repair is performed, the procedure iscalled arthroscopic surgery.
Purpose
Arthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special-ize in treating disorders of the bones and related structures(orthopedics) to help diagnose joint problems. Oncedescribed as essential for those who primarily care for ath-letic injuries, arthroscopy is now a technique commonlyused by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients ofall ages. This procedure is most commonly used to diagnoseknee and shoulder problems, although the elbow, hip, wrist,and ankle may also be examined with an arthroscope.A joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligamentsattach bones to other bones, tendons attach muscles tobones, cartilage lines and helps protect the ends of bones,and a special fluid (synovial fluid) cushions and lubricatesthe structures. Looking inside the joint allows the doctorsto see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopyalso permits earlier diagnosis of many types of joint prob-lems which had been difficult to detect in previous years.
Precautions
Most arthroscopic procedures today are performedin same-day surgery centers where the patient is admittedjust before surgery. A few hours following the procedure,the patient is allowed to return home, although usuallysomeone else must drive. Depending on the type of anes-thesia used, the patient may be told not to eat for severalhours before arriving. Before the procedure, the anesthe-siologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies to local or general anesthetics. Airway obstruction isalways possible in any patient who receives a general
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 364ArthroscopyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 364anesthesia. Because of this, oxygen, suction, and moni-toring equipment must be available. The patient’s cardiacstatus should always be monitored in the event that anycardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy.
Description
The arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct-ly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses and glass-coated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint. Acamera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon tosee a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans-ferred to a monitor located in the operating room at thetime of the arthroscopy. This video technology is alsoimportant for documentation of the arthroscopic proce-dure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthro-scopic examination that a conventional approach to sur-gically expose or “open” the joint (arthrotomy) must beused, a good photographic record will be useful when thesurgeon returns to execute the final surgical plan.The procedure requires the surgeon to make severalsmall incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface intothe joint. Through one or two of the portals, a large-boreneedle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and insertedinto the joint. The joint is inflated with a sterile salinesolution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopicviewing. Often, following a recent traumatic injury to ajoint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte-rior viewing of the joint difficult. In this condition, a con-stant flow of the saline solution is necessary. This inflowof saline solution may be through the cannula with theoutflow through the arthroscope, or the positions may bereversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of theportals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint.
Preparation
Before an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeoncompletes a thorough medical history and evaluation.Important for the accuracy of this diagnostic procedure, a

Arthroscopy is primarily used to help diagnose joint problems.This procedure, most commonly associated with knee andshoulder problems, allows accurate examination and diagnosis of damaged joint ligaments, surfaces, and other related jointstructures.The illustration above indicates the most common entry sites, or portals, in knee arthroscopy. (Illustration by Elec- tronic Illustrators Group.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 365medical history and evaluation may discover other disor-ders of the joint or body parts, proving the procedureunnecessary. This is always an important preliminary step,because paincan often be referred to a joint from anotherarea of the body. Anatomical models and pictures are use-ful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopyand what the surgeon may be looking at specifically.Proper draping of the body part is important to pre-vent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopy,such as the camera, light cords, and inflow and outflowdrains placed in the portals. Draping packs used inarthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapeswith adhesive backing. The surgeon may also place atourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flowto the area during the arthroscopic exam.General or local anesthesia may be used duringarthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used because itreduces the risk of lung and heart complications andallows the patient to go home sooner. The local anesthet-ic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locationsin skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration. Inother cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cordor a main nerve supplying the area. This process is calleda “block,” and it blocks all sensation below the maintrunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral block anes-thetizes the leg from the thigh down (its name comesfrom femur, the thighbone). Most patients are comfort-able once the skin, muscles, and other tissues around thejoint are numbed by the anesthetic; however, somepatients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety about the procedure. (It’s important for the patient toremain still during the arthroscopic examination.)General anesthesia, in which the patient becomesunconcious, may be used if the procedure may be unusu-ally complicated or painful. For example, people whohave relatively “tight” joints may be candidates for gen-eral anesthesia because the procedure may take longerand cause more discomfort.
Aftercare
The portals are closed by small tape strips or stitchesand covered with dressings and a bandage. The patientspends a short amount of time in the recovery room afterarthroscopy. Most patients can go home after about anhour in the recovery room. Pain medication may be pre-scribed for a short period; however, many patients findvarious over-the-counter pain relievers sufficient.Following the surgical procedure, the patient needsto be aware of the signs of infection, which include red-ness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling. The risk ofinfection increases if the incisions become wet too earlyfollowing surgery. Because of this, it is good practice tocover the joint with plastic (for example, a plastic bag)while showering after arthroscopy.The use of crutches is commonplace after arthro-scopy, with progression to independent walking on an “astolerated” basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitationprogram, supervised by a physical therapist, follows short-ly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobilityand strength of the affected joint and limb.Risks
The incidence of complications is low compared tothe high number of arthroscopic procedures performedevery year. Possible complications include infection,swelling, damage to the tissues in the joint, blood clots inthe leg veins (thrombophlebitis), leakage of blood intothe joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that move to the lung(pulmonary embolus), and injury to the nerves aroundthe joint.
Normal results
The goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint prob-lem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal joint func-tion. For example, arthroscopy can be a useful tool inlocating a tear in the joint surface of the knee or locatinga torn ligament of the shoulder. Arthroscopic examina-tion is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performedto repair the problem with appropriate arthroscopic tools.The final result is to decrease pain, increase joint mobili-ty, and thereby improve the overall quality of thepatient’s activities of daily living.
Abnormal results
Less optimal results that may require further treat-ment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, thejoint capsule that naturally forms around the jointbecomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in astiff and less mobile joint. This problem is frequentlycorrected by manipulation and mobilization of the jointwith the patient placed under general anesthesia.Resources

Art therapy
Definition
Art therapy, sometimes called creative arts therapyor expressive arts therapy, encourages people to expressand understand emotions through artistic expression andthrough the creative process.
Purpose
Art therapy provides the client-artist with criticalinsight into emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Key bene-fits of the art therapy process include:• Self-discovery. At its most successful, art therapy trig-gers an emotional catharsis.KEY TERMS
Hemarthrosis—A condition of blood within ajoint.Pulmonary embolus—Blockage of an artery of thelung by foreign matter such as fat, tumor, tissue, ora clot originating from a vein.Thrombophlebitis—Inflamation of a vein with theformation of a thrombus or clot.• Personal fulfillment. The creation of a tangible rewardcan build confidence and nurture feelings of self-worth.Personal fulfillment comes from both the creative andthe analytical components of the artistic process.• Empowerment. Art therapy can help people visuallyexpress emotions and fears that they cannot expressthrough conventional means, and can give them somesense of control over these feelings.• Relaxation and stressrelief. Chronic stress can beharmful to both mind and body. Stress can weaken anddamage the immune system, can cause insomniaand depression, and can trigger circulatory problems (likehigh blood pressure and irregular heartbeats). Whenused alone or in combination with other relaxationtechniques such as guided imagery, art therapy caneffectively relieve stress.• Symptom relief and physical rehabilitation. Art thera-py can also help patients cope with pain. This therapycan promote physiological healing when patients iden-tify and work through anger, resentment, and otheremotional stressors. It is often prescribed to accompanypain control therapy for chronically and terminally illpatients.
Description
OriginsHumans have expressed themselves with symbolsthroughout history. Masks, ritual pottery, costumes, otherobjects used in rituals, cave drawings, Egyptian hiero-glyphics, and Celtic art and symbols are all visualrecords of self-expression and communication throughart. Art has also been associated spiritual power, andartistic forms such as the Hindu and Buddhist mandalaand Native American sand painting are considered pow-erful healing tools.In the late nineteenth century, French psychiatristsAmbrose Tardieu and Paul-Max Simon both publishedstudies on the similar characteristics of and symbolism inthe artwork of the mentally ill. Tardieu and Simonviewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to iden-tify specific types of mental illness or traumatic events.Later, psychologists would use this diagnostic aspect todevelop psychological drawing tests (the Draw-A-Mantest, the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) andprojective personality tests involving visual symbolrecognition (e.g., the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the The- matic Apperception Test[TAT], and the HoltzmanInkblot Test [HIT]).The growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy-chiatric institutions in the twentieth century was animportant factor in the development of art therapy in the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 367Art therapyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 367United States. Milieu therapies (or environmental thera-py) focus on putting the patient in a controlled therapeu-tic social setting that provides the patient with opportuni-ties to gain self-confidence and interact with peers in apositive way. Activities that encourage self-discoveryand empowerment such as art, music, dance, and writingare important components of this approach.Educator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was afollower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated art intopsychotherapy as a means for her patients to visualize andrecognize the unconscious. She founded the WaldenSchool in 1915, where she used students’ artworks in psy-chological counseling. She published extensively on thesubject and taught seminars on the technique at New YorkUniversity in the 1950s. Today, she is considered thefounder of art therapy in the United States.In the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menningerintroduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-basedpsychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men-ninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residencein the following years, and the facility was also consid-ered a leader in the art therapy movement through the1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers whoemerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, HannaYaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental Health),and Janie Rhyne.Art therapy, sometimes called expressive art or artpsychology, encourages self-discovery and emotionalgrowth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre-ation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted inFreud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious andunconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption thatvisual symbols and images are the most accessible andnatural form of communication to the human experience.Patients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, thethoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. Theresulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter-preted by the patient.The “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera-py typically allows patients to gain some level of insightinto their feelings and lets them to work through theseissues in a constructive manner. Art therapy is typicallypracticed with individual, group, or family psychothera-py (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide criticalguidance for these activities, a key feature of effective arttherapy is that the patient/artist, not the therapist, directsthe interpretation of the artwork.Art therapy can be a particularly useful treatmenttool for children, who frequently have limited languageskills. By drawing or using other visual means to expresstroublesome feelings, younger patients can begin toaddress these issues, even if they cannot identify or labelthese emotions with words. Art therapy is also valuablefor adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling totalk about thoughts and feelings.Beyond its use in mental health treatment, art thera-py is also used with traditional medicine to treat organicdiseases and conditions. The connection between mentaland physical health is well documented, and art therapycan promote healing by relieving stress and allowing thepatient to develop coping skills.Art therapy has traditionally centered on visualmediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Somemental healthcare providers have now broadened the def-inition to include music, film, dance, writing, and othertypes of artistic expression.Art therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatientor outpatient treatment program, and can take place inindividual or group therapysessions. Group art therapysessions often take place in hospital, clinic, shelter, andcommunity program settings. These group therapy ses-sions can have the added benefits of positive social inter-action, empathy, and support from peers. The client-artistcan learn that others have similar concerns and issues.
Preparations
Before starting art therapy, the therapist may have anintroductory session with the client-artist to discuss arttherapy techniques and give the client the opportunity toask questions about the process. The client-artist’s comfortwith the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.The therapist ensures that appropriate materials andspace are available for the client-artist, as well as an ade-quate amount of time for the session. If the individualartist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of atrained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time arestill important factors in a successful creative experience.The supplies used in art therapy are limited only bythe artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of thematerials often used include paper, canvas, poster board,assorted paints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks,fabrics, string, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bend-able metals, and natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.).Providing artists with a variety of materials in assortedcolors and textures can enhance their interest in theprocess and may result in a richer, more diverse explo-ration of their emotions in the resulting artwork. Appro-priate tools such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, sup-ply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaningmaterials are also essential.An appropriate workspace should be available forthe creation of art. Ideally, this should be a bright, quiet,comfortable place, with large tables, counters, or other
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 368Art therapyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 368suitable surfaces. The space can be as simple as a kitchenor office table, or as fancy as a specialized artist’s studio.The artist should have adequate time to becomecomfortable with and explore the creative process. Thisis especially true for people who do not consider them-selves “artists” and may be uncomfortable with the con-cept. If performed in a therapy group or one-on-one ses-sion, the art therapist should be available to answer gen-eral questions about materials and/or the creativeprocess. However, the therapist should be careful not toinfluence the creation or interpretation of the work.
Precautions
Art materials and techniques should match the ageand ability of the client. People with impairments, suchas traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological con-dition, may have difficulties with the self-discovery por-tion of the art therapy process depending on their level offunctioning. However, they may still benefit from arttherapy through the sensory stimulation it provides andthe pleasure they get from artistic creation.While art is accessible to all (with or without a ther-apist to guide the process), it may be difficult to tap thefull potential of the interpretive part of art therapy with-out a therapist to guide the process. When art therapy ischosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical con-dition, it should be treated as a supplemental therapy andnot as a substitute for conventional medical treatments.
Research and general acceptance
A wide body of literature supports the use of arttherapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mind-body connection between psychological well-being andphysical health is further documented by studies in thefield, art therapy gains greater acceptance by mainstreammedicine as a therapeutic technique for organic illness.Resources

Asbestosis
Definition
Asbestosis is chronic, progressive inflammation ofthe lung. It is not contagious.
Description
Asbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposureto large quantities of asbestos, a material once widelyused in construction, insulation, and manufacturing.When asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the breathingpassages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar lung tissue. Inadvanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink, stiffen, andbecome honeycombed (riddled with tiny holes).Legislation has reduced use of asbestos in the UnitedStates, but workers who handle automobile brake shoelinings, boiler insulation, ceiling acoustic tiles, electricalequipment, and fire-resistant materials are still exposedto the substance. Asbestos is used in the production ofpaints and plastics. Significant amounts can be releasedinto the atmosphere when old buildings or boats arerazed or remodeled.Asbestosis is most common in men over 40 whohave worked in asbestos-related occupations. Smokers orheavy drinkers have the greatest risk of developing thisdisease. Between 1968 and 1992, more than 10,000Americans over the age of 15 died as a result of asbesto-sis. Nearly 25% of those who died lived in California or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 369AsbestosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 369New Jersey, and most of them had worked in the con-struction or shipbuilding trades.
Causes and symptoms
Occupational exposure is the most common cause ofasbestosis, but the condition also strikes people whoinhale asbestos fiber or who are exposed to waste prod-ucts from plants near their homes. Family members candevelop the disease as a result of inhaling particles ofasbestos dust that cling to workers’ clothes.It is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone whohasn’t been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on aregular basis for at least 10 years. Symptoms of the dis-ease do not usually appear until 15–20 years after initialexposure to asbestos.The first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness of breathfollowing exerciseor other physical activity.The early stages of the disease are also characterized by adry coughand a generalized feeling of illness.As the disease progresses and lung damage increas-es, shortness of breath occurs even when the patient is atrest. Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing upblood are common. So is swelling of the feet, ankles, orhands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis includechest pain, hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients whohave asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thick-ened) fingers. Other potential complications includeheart failure, collapsed (deflated) lung, and pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane that protects the lung).
Diagnosis
Screening of at-risk workers can reveal lung inflamma-tion and lesions characteristic of asbestosis. Patients’ med-ical histories can identify occupations, hobbies, or other sit-uations likely to involve exposure to asbestos fibers.X rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs or anindistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that suggests thepresence of asbestosis. Blood tests are used to measureconcentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonaryfunction tests can be used to assess a patient’s ability toinhale and exhale, and a computed tomography scan(CT) of the lungs can show flat, raised patches associatedwith advanced asbestosis.Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help patients breathemore easily, prevent colds and other respiratory infec-tions, and control complications associated withadvanced disease. Ultrasonic, cool-mist humidifiers orcontrolled coughing can loosen bronchial secretions.Regular exercise helps maintain and improve lungcapacity. Although temporary bed rest may be recom-mended, patients are encouraged to resume their regularactivities as soon as they can.Antibioticsmay be prescribed to combat infection.Aspirinor acetominophen (Tylenol) can relieve minordiscomfort and bronchodilatorsthat are swallowed orinhaled can relax and widen breathing passages.Diuretics(drugs that increase urine production andexcretion) or digitalis glycoside (Digitalis purpurea) are prescribed for some patients. Others may need to usesupplemental oxygen or use less salt.Anyone who develops symptoms of asbestosisshould see a family physician or lung disease specialist.A doctor should be notified if someone who has beendiagnosed with asbestosis:• coughs up blood• continues to lose weight• is short of breath• has chest pain• develops a sudden feverof 101°F (38.3°C) or higher• develops unfamiliar, unexplained symptoms
Prognosis
Asbestosis can’t be cured, but its symptoms can becontrolled. Doctors don’t know why the health of somepatients deteriorates and the condition of others remainthe same, but believe the difference may be due to vary-ing exposures of asbestos. People with asbestosis whosmoke, particularly those who smoke more than onepack of cigarettes each day, are at increased risk for

Prevention
Workers in asbestosis-related industries should haveregular x rays to determine whether their lungs arehealthy. A person whose lung x ray shows a shadowshould eliminate asbestos exposure even if no symptomsof the condition have appeared.Anyone who works with asbestos should wear a pro-tective mask or a hood with a clean-air supply and obeyrecommended procedures to control asbestos dust. Any-one who is at risk of developing asbestosis should:• not smoke• be vaccinated against influenzaand pneumonia• exercise regularly to maintain cardiopulmonary fitness• avoid crowds and people who have respiratory infec-tionsA person who has asbestosis should exercise regu-larly, relax, and conserve energy whenever necessary.Resources

Ascites
Definition
Ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in theabdomen.
Description
Rapidly developing (acute) ascites can occur as acomplication of trauma, perforated ulcer,appendicitis, or inflammation of the colon or other tube-shaped organ(diverticulitis). This condition can also develop whenintestinal fluids, bile, pancreatic juices, or bacteriainvade or inflame the smooth, transparent membrane thatlines the inside of the abdomen (peritoneum). However,ascites is more often associated with liver disease andother long-lasting (chronic) conditions.Types of ascitesCirrhosis, which is responsible for 80% of allinstances of ascites in the United States, triggers a seriesof disease-producing changes that weaken the kidney’sability to excrete sodium in the urine.Pancreatic ascites develops when a cyst that hasthick, fibrous walls (pseudocyst) bursts and permits pan-creatic juices to enter the abdominal cavity.Chylous ascites has a milky appearance caused bylymph that has leaked into the abdominal cavity.Although chylous ascites is sometimes caused by trau-ma, abdominal surgery,tuberculosis, or another peri-toneal infection, it is usually a symptom of lymphoma orsome other cancer.Cancer causes 10% of all instances of ascites in theUnited States. It is most commonly a consequence of dis-ease that originates in the peritoneum (peritoneal carci-nomatosis) or of cancer that spreads (metastasizes) fromanother part of the body.Endocrine and renal ascites are rare disorders.Endocrine ascites, sometimes a symptom of an endocrinesystem disorder, also affects women who are taking fer-tility drugs. Renal ascites develops when blood levels ofalbumin dip below normal. Albumin is the major protein
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 371AscitesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 371in blood plasma. It functions to keep fluid inside theblood vessels.
Causes and symptoms
CausesThe two most important factors in the production ofascites due to chronic liver disease are:• Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a changein the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchange(osmotic pressure). This change in pressure allows fluidto seep out of the blood vessels.• An increase in the pressure within the branches of theportal vein that run through liver (portal hypertension). Portal hypertension is caused by the scarring thatoccurs in cirrhosis. Blood that cannot flow through theliver because of the increased pressure leaks into theabdomen and causes ascites.Other conditions that contribute to ascites develop-ment include:• hepatitis• heart or kidney failure• inflammation and fibrous hardening of the sac that con-tains the heart (constrictive pericarditis)Persons who have systemic lupus erythematosusbut do not have liver disease or portal hypertension occa-sionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid activitysometimes causes pronounced ascites, but inflammationof the pancreas (pancreatitis) rarely causes significantaccumulations of fluid.SymptomsSmall amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not usual-ly produce symptoms. Massive accumulations may cause:• rapid weight gain• abdominal discomfort and distention• shortness of breath• swollen anklesDiagnosis
Skin stretches tightly across an abdomen that con-tains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies flat,and the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor taps theabdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks to bulge.Physical examinationgenerally enables doctors todistinguish ascites from pregnancy, intestinal gas,obe- sity, or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog-raphy scans(CT) can detect even small amounts offluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by insertinga needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic para- centesis) can help identify the cause of the accumulation.
Treatment
Reclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneysabsorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest and alow-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs (diuretics) may be prescribed if initial treatment is ineffective. The weightand urinary output of patients using diuretics must becarefully monitored for signs of :• hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid)• azotemia (abnormally high blood levels of nitrogen-bearing materials)• potassium imbalance• high sodium concentration. If the patient consumesmore salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses ofdiuretics should be prescribedModerate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are treat-ed by draining large amounts of fluid (large-volumeparacentesis) from the patient’s abdomen. This procedureis safer than diuretic therapy. It causes fewer complica-tions and requires a shorter hospital stay.Large-volume paracentesis is also the preferredtreatment for massive ascites. Diuretics are sometimes

Alternative treatment
Dietary alterations, focused on reducing salt intake,should be a part of the treatment. In less severe cases,herbal diuretics like dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) can help eliminate excess fluid and provide potassium. Potas-sium-rich foods like low-fat yogurt, mackerel, cantaloupe,and baked potatoes help balance excess sodium intake.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends upon the condition that iscausing the ascites. Carcinomatous ascites has a very badprognosis. However, salt restriction and diuretics cancontrol ascites caused by liver disease in many cases.Therapy should also be directed towards the under-lying disease that produces the ascites. Cirrhosis shouldbe treated by abstinence from alcohol and appropriatediet. The new interferon agents maybe helpful in treatingchronic hepatitis.
Prevention
Modifying or restricting use of salt can prevent mostcases of recurrent ascites.KEY TERMS

Aspartate aminotransferase test
Definition
The Aspartate aminotransferase test measures levelsof AST, an enzyme released into the blood when certainorgans or tissues, particularly the liver and heart, areinjured. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also knownas serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT).
Purpose
The determination of AST levels aids primarily inthe diagnosis of liver disease. In the past, the AST testwas used to diagnose heart attack(myocardial infarc-tion or MI) but more accurate blood tests have largelyreplaced it for cardiac purposes.
Description
AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample,usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the bendof the elbow.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 373Aspartate aminotransferase testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 373AST is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle,kidney, pancreas, spleen, lung, red blood cells, and braintissue. When disease or injury affects these tissues, thecells are destroyed and AST is released into the blood-stream. The amount of AST is directly related to thenumber of cells affected by the disease or injury, but thelevel of elevation depends on the length of time that theblood is tested after the injury. Serum AST levelsbecome elevated eight hours after cell injury, peak at 24-36 hours, and return to normal in three to seven days. Ifthe cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels willremain elevated.One of the most important uses for AST determina-tion has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart attack,or MI. AST can assist in determining the timing andextent of a recent MI, although it is less specific than cre-atine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB, myglobin, tro-ponins, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Assuming nofurther cardiac injury occurs, the AST level rises within6-10 hours after an acute attack, peaks at 12-48 hours,and returns to normal in three to four days. Myocardialinjuries such as angina(chest pain) or pericarditis(inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane aroundthe heart) do not increase AST levels.AST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liverdisease. Although not specific for liver disease, it canbe used in combination with other enzymes to monitorthe course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silenthepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of elevat-ed AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessivealcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderatelyelevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise toover 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside theliver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levelsthat can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then rapid-ly fall. In cases of cirrhosis, the AST level is related tothe amount of active inflammation of the liver. Determi-nation of AST also assists in early recognition of toxichepatitis that results from exposure to drugs toxic to theliver, like acetaminophenand cholesterol loweringmedications.Other disorders or diseases in which the AST deter-mination can be valuable include acute pancreatitis, muscle disease, trauma, severe burn, and infectiousmononucleosis.
Preparation
The physician may require discontinuation of anydrugs that might affect the test. These types include suchdrugs as antihypertensives (for treatment of high bloodpressure), coumarin-type anticoagulants (blood-thinningdrugs), digitalis, erythromycin (an antibiotic), oral con-KEY TERMS

Sudden death of part of the heartmuscle, characterized, in most cases, by severe,unremitting chest pain.traceptives, and opiates, among others. The patient mayalso need to cut back on strenuous activities temporarily,because exercisecan also elevate AST for a day or two.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may includeslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for the AST are laboratory-specific,but can range from 3-45 units/L (units per liter).
Abnormal results
Striking elevations of AST (400-4000 units/L) arefound in almost all forms of acute hepatic necrosis, suchas viral hepatitis and carbon tetrachloride poisoning. In alcoholics, even moderate doses of the analgesic aceta-minophen have caused extreme elevations (1,960-29,700units/L). Moderate rises of AST are seen in jaundice, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma. Approximately 80%of patients with infectious mononucleosis show eleva-tions in the range of 100-600 units/L.Resources

Definition
Aspergillosis refers to several forms of diseasecaused by a fungus in the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillo-sis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal, eyes,nose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some individuals, theinfection can even invade bone and the membranes thatenclose the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
Description
Aspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungscaused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungusAspergillus. Spores are the small particles that mostfungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone isexposed to this fungus in their daily environment, itrarely causes disease. When Aspergillusdoes cause dis-ease, however, it usually occurs in those individuals withweakened immune systems (immunocompromised) orwho have a history of respiratory ailments. Because itdoes not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis isgenerally thought to be underdiagnosed and underre-ported. Furthermore, many patients with the more severeforms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple, complexhealth problems, such as AIDSor a blood disorder likeleukemia, which can further complicate diagnosis andtreatment.Once considered particularly rare, the incidence ofreported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the devel-opment of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis andadvances made in other areas of medicine, such as withthe increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corti-costeroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating vari-ous types of cancerbut that decrease the individual’simmune response, making them more susceptible toother diseases like aspergillosis.Our advanced ability to perform tissue and organtransplants has also increased the number of people vul-nerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients, partic-ularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplants,are highly susceptible to Aspergillus, which may be cir-culating in the hospital air.Aspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadlythreat for two primary reasons:• Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals whoare already ill or have weakened immune systems, suchas patients who have undergone chemotherapyfor cancer.• None of the currently available antifungal drugs arereliably effective against Aspergillus.Causes and symptoms
Aspergillusis a fungus that is found almost everywhere,but particularly in soil, water, decaying vegetation, andstored grain. The fungus has also been cultured from ventila-tion systems and may be stirred up during building renova-tions. The species most commonly identified in patients withconfirmed disease are A. fumigatusand A. flavus.Airborne Aspergillusspores enter the body primarilythrough inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eye.Normally functioning immune systems are generally ableto cope without consequent development of aspergillosis.It is important to make distinctions between the vari-ous forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and prognosisvaries considerably among types. Aspergillosis as a diag-nosis refers to three general forms:• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) isseen in patients with long-standing asthma, particular-ly in patients taking oral corticosteroidsfor a longperiod of time. This is usually the least serious andmost treatable form.• Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungalspores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that havebeen pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosisor prior pneumonia. There are several available treatments,although the success rate varies with each treatment.• Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in whichthe fungus spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream and invades other organ systems. Once estab-lished, invasive fungal infections are extremely difficultto cure and, as a result, the associated deathrate is extremely high.Aspergillusinfection of the ear (called otomycosis),can produce itchingand a discharge, sometimes noticedas a spot on the pillow. Fungal infection of the cornea ofthe eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness, ifnot diagnosed and treated promptly.
Diagnosis
Aspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnosebecause the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing, if present at all, are common to many respiratory disor-ders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures are notvery helpful. The presence of Aspergillusis so common,even in asthmatics, that a positive culture alone is insuffi-cient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially more useful,screening tools include examining the sample obtainedafter repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lungwith water (bronchial lavage), but examining a tissuesample (biopsy) is the most reliable diagnostic tool.Researchers are currently attempting to develop a practi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 375AspergillosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 375cal, specific, and rapid blood test that would confirmAspergillusinfection.Signs of ABPA include a worsening of bronchialasthma accompanied by a low-grade fever. Brown flecksor clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary func-tion tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting anobstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels of anantibody produced in response to Aspergillusand of cer-tain immune system cells may indicate a specific aller-gic-type immune system response.A fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usuallydoes not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag-nosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or moreof patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemoptysis) at least once, and this may become repetitive and serious.Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that the patientmay be suffering from an aspergilloma.In patients with lowered immune systems who are atrisk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physicianmay use a combination of blood culturewith visual diag-nostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans(CT) and radiography, to arrive at a likely diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment method selected depends on the formof aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated with manyof the same drugs used to treat asthma, such as systemicsteroids. Long-term therapy may be required, however, toprevent recurrence. Antifungal agents are not recom-mended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo-ma, it may become necessary to surgically remove orreduce the size of a fungal mass, especially if the patientcontinues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affectingthe nose and nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.In non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs maybe indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone)is the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will dependon the patient’s condition but usually begins with a smalltest dose and then escalates. Less than one-third ofpatients are likely to respond to amphotericin B, and itsside effects often limit its use. For patients who do notrespond to oral amphotericin B, another option is a dif-ferent formulation of the same drug called liposomalamphotericin B.For patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler-ate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole(Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also beenapproved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months. Giv-ing itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if pre-scribed in combination with certain other drugs byincreasing the concentrations of both drugs in the bloodand creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Evenantacidscan significantly affect itraconazole levels. As aresult, drug levels must be continually monitored toensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels.Two other methods of treatment are being studied:direct instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungsand administration of antifungals using a nebulizer.Instilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazoledirectly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ball(aspergilloma) itself has been helpful in stoppingepisodes of hemoptysis, but not in preventing futurerecurrences. Furthermore, many patients with aspergillo-mas are poor risks for surgery because their lung func-tion is already compromised. As a result, instillation of afungal agent should only be considered in those whohave significant hempotysis.A popular method of treating some respiratory dis-orders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid andaerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled intothe lungs through a device called a nebulizer. However,this has not yet been shown to improve the patient’s con-dition in cases of aspergillosis, possibly because the drugis not reaching the aspergilloma.At this point, preventative therapy for aspergillosis isnot suggested for susceptible individuals, primarilybecause overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal infec-tions may lead to the development of drug-resistant

Aspergillosis is an infection of the lungs caused by inhala-tion of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus.(Illustra- tion by Electronic Illustrators Group).GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 376aspergillosis against which current antifungal drugs areno longer effective.
Prognosis
The likelihood of recovery from aspergillosis dependson any underlying medical conditions, the patient’s gener-al health, and the specific type of aspergillosis. If the prob-lem is based on an allergic response, as in ABPA, thepatient will likely respond well to systemic steroids.Patients who require lung surgery, especially thosewho have problems with coughing up blood, have a mortal-ity rate of about 7-14%, and complications or recurrencemay result in a higher overall death rate. However, by treat-ing aspergilloma with other, non-surgical methods, that riskrises to 26%, making surgery a better option in some cases.Unfortunately, the prognosis for the most seriousform, invasive aspergillosis, is quite poor, largely becausethese patients have little resilience due to their underlyingdisorders. Death rates have ranged from about 50% insome studies to as high as 95% for bone-marrow recipientsand patients with AIDS. The course of the illness can berapid, resulting in death within a few months of diagnosis.
Prevention
Fungal infection by Aspergilluspresents a majorchallenge, particularly in the patient with a suppressedimmune system (immunocompromised). Hospitals andgovernment health agencies continually seek ways tominimize exposure for hospitalized patients. Practicalsuggestions are minimal but include moving leaf pilesaway from the house. Unfortunately, overall avoidance ofthis fungus is all but impossible because it is present inthe environment virtually everywhere. Research effortsare being directed at enhancing patients’ resistance toAspergillusrather than trying to eliminate exposure tothe fungus. Given the growing number of people withimmune disorders or whose immune systems have beensuppressed in the course of treating another disease,research and clinical trials for new antifungal agents willbe increasingly important in the future.Resources

Aspirin
Definition
Aspirin is a medicine that relieves painand reducesfever.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 377AspirinGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 377Purpose
Aspirin is used to relieve many kinds of minor achesand pains—headaches, toothaches, muscle pain, men-strual cramps, the joint pain from arthritis, and achesassociated with colds and flu. Some people take aspirindaily to reduce the risk of stroke,heart attack, or other heart problems.
Description
Aspirin—also known as acetylsalicylic acid—is soldover the counter and comes in many forms, from thefamiliar white tablets to chewing gum and rectal supposi-tories. Coated, chewable, buffered, and extended releaseforms are available. Many other over-the-counter medi-cine contain aspirin. Alka-Seltzer Original EffervescentAntacid Pain Reliever, for example, contains aspirin forpain relief and sodium bicarbonate to relieve acid indi- gestion,heartburn, and sour stomach.Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicy-lates. Other members of this group include sodium salicy-late, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. Thesedrugs are more expensive and no more effective thanaspirin. However, they are a little easier on the stomach.Aspirin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and pro-vides quick and relatively long-lasting pain relief. Aspirinalso reduces inflammation. Researchers believe theseeffects come about because aspirin blocks the productionof pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins.In addition to relieving pain and reducing inflamma-tion, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part of thebrain that regulates temperature. The brain then signalsthe blood vessels to widen, which allows heat to leavethe body more quickly.
Recommended dosage
Adults
TO RELIEVE PAIN OR REDUCE FEVER. one to twotablets every three to four hours, up to six times per day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF STROKE. one tablet fourtimes a day or two tablets twice a day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK. Check witha physician for the proper dose and number of times perweek aspirin should, if at all, be taken.ChildrenCheck with a physician.
Precautions
Aspirin—even children’s aspirin—should never begiven to children or teenagers with flu-like symptoms orchickenpox. Aspirin can cause Reye’s syndrome, a life- threatening condition that affects the nervous system andliver. As many as 30% of children and teenagers whodevelop Reye’s syndrome die. Those who survive mayhave permanent brain damage.Check with a physician before giving aspirin to achild under 12 years for arthritis, rheumatism, or anycondition that requires long-term use of the drug.No one should take aspirin for more than 10 days ina row unless told to do so by a physician. Anyone withfever should not take aspirin for more than 3 days with-out a physician’s consent. Do not to take more than therecommended daily dosage.People in the following categories should not useaspirin without first checking with their physician:• Pregnant women. Aspirin can cause bleeding problemsin both the mother and the developing fetus. Aspirincan also cause the infant’s weight to be too low at birth.• Women who are breastfeeding. Aspirin can pass intobreast milk and may affect the baby.• People with a history of bleeding problems.• People who are taking blood-thinning drugs, such aswarfarin (Coumadin).• People with a history of ulcers.• People with a history of asthma,nasal polyps, or both.These people are more likely to be allergic to aspirin.• People who are allergic to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indo-methacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamate sodium, naprox-en, sulindac, tolmetin, or the orange food-coloring tar-trazine. They may also be allergic to aspirin.• People with AIDSor AIDS-related complex who aretaking AZT (zidovudine). Aspirin can increase the riskof bleeding in these patients.• People taking certain other drugs (discussed in Interac-tions).• People with liver damage or severe kidney failure.Aspirin should not be taken before surgery, as it canincrease the risk of excessive bleeding. Anyone who isscheduled for surgery should check with his or her sur-geon to find out how long before surgery to avoid takingaspirin.Aspirin can cause stomach irritation. To reduce thelikelihood of that problem, take aspirin with food or milkor drink a full 8-oz glass of water with it. Taking coatedor buffered aspirin can also help. Be aware that drinkingalcohol can make the stomach irritation worse.Stop taking aspirin immediately and call a physicianif any of these symptoms develop:• ringing or buzzing in the ears
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 378AspirinGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 378• hearing loss•dizziness• stomach pain that does not go awayDo not take aspirin that has a vinegary smell. That isa sign that the aspirin is too old and ineffective. Flushsuch aspirin down the toilet.Because aspirin can increase the risk of excessivebleeding, do not take aspirin daily over long periods—toreduce the risk of stroke or heart attack, for example—unless advised to do so by a physician.

People who are allergic to aspirin or thosewho have asthma,rhinitis, or polyps in the nose mayhave trouble breathing after taking aspirin.
Interactions
Aspirin may increase, decrease, or change theeffects of many drugs. Aspirin can make drugs such asmethotrexate (Rheumatrex) and valproic acid (Depakote,Depakene) more toxic. If taken with blood-thinningdrugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and dicumarol,aspirin can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.Aspirin counteracts the effects of other drugs, such asangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors andbeta blockers, which lower blood pressure, and medi-cines used to treat gout(probenecid and sulfinpyrazone).Blood pressure may drop unexpectedly and cause faint- ingor dizziness if aspirin is taken along with nitroglyc-erin tablets. Aspirin may also interact with diuretics, dia- betes medicines, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs(NSAIDs), seizure medications, and steroids.Anyone who is taking these drugs should ask his or herphysician whether they can safely take aspirin.Resources

Asthma
Definition
Today asthma is viewed as a chronic (long-lasting)inflammatory disease of the airways. In those susceptibleto asthma, this inflammation causes the airways to nar-row periodically. This, in turn, produces wheezingand breathlessness, sometimes to the point where the patient
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 379AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 379gasps for air. Obstruction to air flow either stops sponta-neously or responds to a wide range of treatments, butcontinuing inflammation makes the airways hyper-responsive to stimuli such as cold air,exercise, dust mites, pollutants in the air, and even stressand anxiety.
Description
About 10 million Americans have asthma, and thenumber seems to be increasing. Between 1982-92, therate actually rose by 42%. Not only is asthma becomingmore frequent, but it also is a more severe disease thanbefore, despite modern drug treatments. In the same 10-year period, the deathrate from asthma in the UnitedStates increased by 35%.The changes that take place in the lungs of asth-matic persons makes the airways (the “breathing tubes,”or bronchiand the smaller bronchioles) hyper-reactiveto many different types of stimuli that don’t affecthealthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle tissue inthe walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the cells liningthe airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spaces.Both these actions cause the bronchi to become nar-rowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result, an asthmaticperson has to make a much greater effort to breathe inair and to expel it.Cells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells,release certain substances that cause the bronchial mus-cle to contract and stimulate mucus formation. Thesesubstances, which include histamine and a group ofchemicals called leukotrienes, also bring white bloodcells into the area, which is a key part of the inflammato-ry response. Many patients with asthma are prone toreact to such “foreign” substances as pollen, house dustmites, or animal dander; these are called allergens. Onthe other hand, asthma affects many patients who are not“allergic” in this way.Asthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence,but it also may first appear during adult years. While thesymptoms may be similar, certain important aspects ofasthma are different in children and adults.Child-onset asthmaWhen asthma does begin in childhood, it often doesso in a child who is likely, for genetic reasons, to becomesensitized to common “allergens” in the environment(atopic person). When these children are exposed tohouse-dust mites, animal proteins, fungi, or other poten-tial allergens, they produce a type of antibody that isintended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials. Thishas the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to par-ticular materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to anasthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present inat least one-third and as many as half of the general pop-ulation. When an infant or young child wheezes duringviral infections, the presence of allergy (in the child itselfor a close relative) is a clue that asthma may well contin-ue throughout childhood.Adult-onset asthmaAllergenic materials may also play a role whenadults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start atany age and in a wide variety of situations. Many adultswho are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis or nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to aspirinand related drugs. Another major source of adult asthma isexposure at work to animal products, certain forms ofplastic, wood dust, or metals.
Causes and symptoms
In most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller-gen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissuechanges leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon-striction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at leastminimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat-ing asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irritantis causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once asthmais present, symptoms can be set off or made worse if thepatient also has rhinitis(inflammation of the lining ofthe nose) or sinusitis. When, for some reason, stomachacid passes back up the esophagus (acid reflux), this canalso make asthma worse. A viral infection of the respira-tory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirinand a type of drug called beta-blockers, often used totreat high blood pressure, can also worsen the symptomsof asthma.The most important inhaled allergens giving rise toattacks of asthma are:• animal dander• mites in house dust• fungi (molds) that grow indoors• cockroach allergens• pollen• occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particlesof industrial materials in the airInhaling tobacco smoke, either by smokingor being near people who are smoking, can irritate the airwaysand trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollutants can have asimilar effect. In addition, there are three important fac-tors that regularly produce attacks in certain asthmaticpatients, and they may sometimes be the sole cause ofsymptoms. They are:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 380AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 380• inhaling cold air (cold-induced asthma)• exercise-induced asthma (in certain children, asthma iscaused simply by exercising)• stress or a high level of anxietyWheezing is often very obvious, but mild asthmaticattacks may be confirmed when the physician listens tothe patient’s chest with a stethoscope. Besides wheezingand being short of breath, the patient may coughand may report a feeling of “tightness” in the chest. Childrenmay have itchingon their back or neck at the start of anattack. Wheezing is often loudest when the patientbreathes out, in an attempt to expel used air through thenarrowed airways. Some asthmatics are free of symp-toms most of the time but may occasionally be short ofbreath for a brief time. Others spend much of their days(and nights) coughing and wheezing, until properly treat-ed. Crying or even laughing may bring on an attack.Severe episodes are often seen when the patient gets aviral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavyload of an allergen or irritant. Asthmatic attacks may lastonly a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (acondition called status asthmaticus).Being short of breath may cause a patient to becomevery anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and use the mus-cles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe. Thepatient may be able to say only a few words at a timebefore stopping to take a breath. Confusion and a bluishtint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is muchtoo low, and that emergency treatment is needed. In asevere attack that lasts for some time, some of the airsacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects withinthe chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in enoughair. Almost always, even patients with the most severeattacks will recover completely.
Diagnosis
Apart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam-iner should look for maximum chest expansion whiletaking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neckmuscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasalpolyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are oftennoted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like atopic dermatitisor eczema, are a tipoff that the patient hasallergic problems.Inquiring about a family history of asthma or aller- giescan be a valuable indicator of asthma. The diagnosismay be strongly suggested when typical symptoms andsigns are present. A test called spirometry measures howrapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in thelungs. Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drugthat widens the air passages (a bronchodilator) will showwhether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is avery typical finding in asthma. Often patients use a relat-ed instrument, called a peak flow meter, to keep track ofasthma severity when at home.Often, it is difficult to determine what is triggeringasthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,although an allergic skin response does not always meanthat the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also,the body’s immune system produces antibody to fight offthe allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea-sured by a blood test. This will show how sensitive thepatient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is stillin doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen whileusing a spirometer to detect airway narrowing. Spirome-try can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exer-cise-induced asthma is a possibility. A chest x raywill help rule out other disorders.Treatment
Patients should be periodically examined and havetheir lung function measured by spirometry to make surethat treatment goals are being met. These goals are to pre-vent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function asclose to normal as possible, and to allow patients to pur-sue their normal activities including those requiring exer-tion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmat-ic symptoms while causing few or no side-effects.Drugs
METHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine drugis theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatoryeffect, and is especially helpful in controlling nighttimesymptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patientcannot use an inhaler to maintain long-term control, sus-tained-release theophylline is a good alternative. Theblood levels of the drug must be measured periodically,as too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm orconvulsions.
BETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which arebronchodilators, are the best choice for relieving suddenattacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from beingtriggered by exercise. Some agonists, such as albuterol,act mainly in lung cells and have little effect on otherorgans, such as the heart. These drugs generally start act-ing within minutes, but their effects last only four to sixhours (although longer-acting forms are being devel-oped). They may be taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.
STEROIDS. These drugs, which resemble naturalbody hormones, block inflammation and are extremelyeffective in relieving symptoms of asthma. Whensteroids are taken by inhalation for a long period, asthma
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 381AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 381attacks become less frequent as the airways become lesssensitive to allergens. This is the strongest medicine forasthma, and can control even severe cases over the longterm and maintain good lung function. Steroids cancause numerous side-effects, however, including bleed-ing from the stomach, loss of calcium from bones,cataractsin the eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patientsusing steroids for lengthy periods may also have prob-lems with wound healing, may gain weight, and may suf-fer mental problems. In children, growth may be slowed.Besides being inhaled, steroids may be taken by mouthor injected, to rapidly control severe asthma.
LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. Leukotriene modifiersare a new type of drug that can be used in place ofsteroids, for older children or adults who have a milddegree of asthma that persists. They work by counteract-ing leukotrienes, which are substances released by whiteblood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to con-strict and promote mucus secretion.OTHER DRUGS. Cromolyn and nedocromil are anti-inflammatory drugs that are often used as initial treatmentto prevent asthmatic attacks over the long term in children.They can also prevent attacks when given before exerciseor when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided. Theseare safe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken regular-ly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cholinergic drugs,such as atropine, are useful in controlling severe attackswhen added to an inhaled beta-receptor agonist. They helpwiden the airways and suppress mucus production.If a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen thatcannot be avoided and it has been difficult to controlsymptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth try-

In normal bronchioles the airwayis open and unobstructed.
During an attack, the bronchioles of anasthma sufferer are constricted by bandsof muscle around them. They may befurther obstructed by increased mucusproduction and tissue inflammation.

Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen areinjected over a period of three to five years, so that thebody can build up an effective immune response. Thereis a risk that this treatment may itself cause the airwaysto become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attack.Not all experts are enthusiastic about immunotherapy,although some studies have shown that it does reduceasthmatic symptoms caused by exposure to house-dustmites, ragweed pollen, and cats.Managing asthmatic attacksA severe asthma attack should be treated as quicklyas possible. It is most important for a patient suffering anacute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may benecessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help thepatient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeat-edly or continuously. If the patient does not respondpromptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course ofsteroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make arecurrence less likely.Maintaining controlLong-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling abeta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters thedose. Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhalerto be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug. Onceasthma has been controlled for several weeks or months, itis worth trying to cut down on drug treatment, but this mustbe done gradually. The last drug added should be the first tobe reduced. Patients should be seen every one to sixmonths, depending on the frequency of attacks.Starting treatment at home, rather than in hospital,makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain asense of control over the disease. All patients should betaught how to monitor their symptoms so that they willknow when an attack is starting, and those with moderateor severe asthma should know how to use a flow meter.They should also have a written “action plan” to follow ifsymptoms suddenly become worse, including how toadjust their medication and when to seek medical help. Ifmore intense treatment is necessary, it should be contin-ued for several days. Over-the-counter “remedies” shouldbe avoided. When deciding whether a patient should behospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity ofsymptoms, current medication, and whether good supportis available at home all must be taken into account.Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered if:• there has been a life-threatening asthma attack orsevere, persistent asthma• treatment for three to six months has not met its goals• some other condition, such as nasal polyps or chroniclung disease, is complicating asthma• special tests, such as allergy skin testing or an allergenchallenge, are needed• intensive steroid therapy has been necessarySpecial populations
INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especiallyimportant to closely watch the course of asthma in youngpatients. Treatment is cut down when possible and ifthere is no clear improvement, some other treatmentshould be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe asth-matic symptoms, steroids may help. The health careprovider should write out an asthma treatment plan forthe child’s school. Asthmatic children often need med-ication at school to control acute symptoms or to preventexercise- induced attacks. Proper management will usu-ally allow a child to take part in play activities. Only as alast resort should activities be limited.
THE ELDERLY. Older persons often have other types ofobstructive lung disease, such as chronic bronchitisor emphysema. This makes it important to know to whatextent the symptoms are caused by asthma. Giving steroidsfor two to three weeks can help determine this. Side-effectsfrom beta-receptor agonist drugs (including a speedingheart and tremor) may be more common in older patients.These patients may benefit from receiving an anti-choliner-gic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theo-phylline is given, the dose should be limited, as olderpatients are less able to clear this drug from their blood.Steroids should be avoided, as they often make elderlypatients confused and agitated. Steroids may also furtherweaken the bones.
Prognosis
Most patients with asthma respond well when thebest drug or combination of drugs is found, and they areable to lead relatively normal lives. More than half ofaffected children stop having attacks by the time theyreach 21 years of age. Many others have less frequentand less severe attacks as they grow older. Urgent mea-sures to control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment toprevent attacks are equally important. A small minorityof patients will have progressively more trouble breath-ing and they run a risk of going into respiratory failureand they must receive intensive treatment.
Prevention
Minimizing exposure to allergensThere are a number of ways to cut down exposure tothe common allergens and irritants that provoke asthmat-ic attacks, or to avoid them altogether:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 383AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 383• If the patient is sensitive to a family pet, remove theanimal or at least keep it out of the bedroom (with thebedroom door closed). Keep the pet away from carpetsand upholstered furniture. Remove all feathers.• To reduce exposure to house dust mites, remove wall-to-wall carpeting, keep the humidity down, and use spe-cial pillow and mattress covers. Cut down on stuffedtoys, and wash them each week in hot water.• If cockroach allergen is causing asthma attacks, kill theroaches (using poison, traps, or boric acid rather thanchemicals). Take care not to leave food or garbageexposed.• Keep indoor air clean by vacuuming carpets once ortwice a week (with the patient absent), avoid usinghumidifiers, and do use air conditioning during warmweather (so that the windows can be closed).• Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.• Do not exercise outside when air pollution levels arehigh.• When asthma is related to exposure at work, take allprecautions, including wearing a mask and, if neces-sary, arrange to work in a safer area.Resources

Astigmatism
Definition
Astigmatism is the result of an inability of thecornea to properly focus an image onto the retina. Theresult is a blurred image.
Description
The cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is atransparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps tofocus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photoreceptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses viathe optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.The cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of thecornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light thatpasses through that part of the cornea. The bending oflight is called refraction and focusing problems with thecornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive dis-orders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that resultsfrom an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the cornea isspherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in astigma-tism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a foot-ball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.These two meridians generally have a constant curvatureand are generally perpendicular to each other (regularastigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more thantwo meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart. Apoint of light, therefore, going through an astigmaticcornea will have two points of focus, instead of one nicesharp image on the retina. This will cause the person tohave blurry vision. What the blur looks like will dependupon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism. Aperson with nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 384AstigmatismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 384(hyperopia) may see a dot as a blurred circle. A personwith astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred ovalor frankfurter-shaped blur.Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problemsin the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature ofthe lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea isusually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have theleast amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increaseduring childhood, as the eye is developing.
Causes and symptoms
The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo-ple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parentscan notice that a child may have astigmatism when thechild can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear-ly than others. For example, lines going across may seemclearer than lines going up and down.Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight ofthe upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion,surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or scarring to thecornea, the presence of tumors in the eyelid, or a develop-mental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar-ring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in whichthe cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usuallyoccurs around pubertyand is more common in women.Although the causes of keratoconus are unknown, it maybe hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in peo-ple with allergies. The center of the cone may not be inline with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a rolein the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar lev-els can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye. Thisprocess usually occurs slowly and, often, is only noticedwhen the diabetic has started treatment to control theirblood sugar. The return to a more normal blood sugarallows the lens to return to normal and this change issometimes noticed by the patient as farsightedness.Because of this, diabetics should wait until their bloodsugar is under control for at least one month to allowvision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses.
Diagnosis
Patients seek treatment because of blurred vision. Avariety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism duringthe eye exam. The patient may be asked to describe theastigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward froma center. People with astigmatism will see some of thelines more clearly than others. One diagnostic instrumentused is the keratometer. This measures the curvature ofthe central cornea. It measures the amount and directionof the curvature. A corneal topographer can measure alarger area of the cornea. It can measure the central areaand mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projectsa series of concentric light rings onto the cornea. Mis-shapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areasof the light pattern that do not appear concentric on thecornea. Because these instruments are measuring thecornea, it is also important to have a refraction in case thelens is also contributing to the astigmatism. The refrac-tion measures the optics or visual status of the eye andthe result is the eyeglass prescription. The refraction iswhen the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctoris putting different lenses in front of the patient’s eyesand asks which one looks better. Treatment
Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindricallenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses. Theunit of measure describing the power of the lens system orlens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are shaped tocounteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are caus-ing the difficulty. Because the correction is in one direction,it is written in terms of the axis the correction is in. On aprescription, for example, it may say -1.00D /H11003180°.

Gener-ally, if visual acuity is good and the patient experiencesno overt symptoms, treatment is not necessary. Whentreating larger amounts of astigmatism, or astigmatismfor the first time, the doctor may not totally correct theastigmatism. The cylindrical correction in the eyeglassesmay make the floor appear to tilt, thus making it difficultfor the patient at first. Generally, the doctor will placelenses in a trial frame to allow the patient to try the pre-scription at the exam. It may take a week or so to getused to the glasses, however, if the patient is having aproblem they should contact their doctor, who mightwant to recheck the prescription.Contact lenses that are used to correct astigmatismare called toric lenses. When a person blinks, the contactlens rotates. In toric lenses, it is important for the lens toreturn to the same position each time. Lenses have thinzones, or cut-off areas (truncated), or have other ways torotate and return to the correct position. Soft toric lensesare available in a variety of prescriptions, materials, andeven in tints. Patients should ask their doctors about thepossibility of toric lenses.In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved laser treatment of astigmatism. Patients consid-ering this should make sure the surgeon has a lot of expe-rience in the procedure and discuss the possible sideeffects or risks with the doctor. In the case of kerato-conus, a corneal transplant is performed if the astigma-tism can not be corrected with hard contact lenses.
Prognosis
Astigmatism is a condition that may be present atbirth. It may also be acquired if something is distorting thecornea. Vision can generally be corrected with eyeglassesKEY TERMS

Undercorrection can be solved by repeating the operation.Resources

Aston-Patterning
Definition
Aston-Patterning is an integrated system of move-ment education, bodywork, ergonomic adjustments, andfitness training that recognizes the relationship betweenthe body and mind for well being. It helps people whoseek a remedy from acute or chronic painby teachingthem to improve postural and movement patterns.
Purpose
Aston-Patterning assists people in finding more effi-cient and less stressful ways of performing the simplemovements of everyday life to dissipate tension in thebody. This is done through massage, alteration of theenvironment, and fitness training.
Description
Seeking to solve movement problems, Aston-Pat-terning helps make the most of their own unique bodytypes rather than trying to force them to conform to anideal. Unlike Rolfing, it doesn’t strive for linear symme-try. Rather it works with asymmetry in the human bodyto develop patterns of alignment and movement that feelright to the individual. Aston also introduced the idea ofworking in a three-dimensional spinal pattern.Aston-Patterning sessions have four general compo-nents. They are:• A personal history that helps the practitioner assess theclient’s needs.• Pre-testing, in which the practitioner and the client explorepatterns of movement and potential for improvement.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 386Aston-PatterningGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 386• Movement education and bodywork, including mas-sage, myofacial release, and arthrokinetics, to helprelease tension and make new movement patterns easier.• Post-testing, when pre-testing movements are repeated,allowing the client to feel the changes that have takenplace and integrate them into daily life.Aston-Patterning requires more participation fromthe client than many bodywork techniques. The massageaspect of Aston-Patterning is designed around a three-dimensional, non-compressive touch that releases pat-terns of tension in the body. It is gentler than Rolfing.Myokinetics uses touch to release tension in the face andneck. Arthrokinetics addresses tension at bones andjoints. This massage is accompanied by education abouthow new movement patterns may be established.In addition to Aston-Patterning sessions, clients arealso helped to examine their environment for factors, suchas seating or sleeping arrangements, that may limit theirbody function and introduce tension. Finally, they maychoose to participate in the Aston fitness training programthat includes loosening techniques based on self-massage,toning, stretching, and cardiovascular fitness.KEY TERMS
Rolfing—Developed by Dr. Ida Rolf (1896–1979),rolfing is a systematic approach to relieving stresspatterns and dysfunctions in the body’s structurethrough the manipulation of the highly pliant myofa-cial (connective) tissue. It assists the body in reorga-nizing its major segments into vertical alignment.
Preparations
No special preparation need be taken.
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary when partici-pating.
Side effects
No undesirable side effects are reported. Usuallyclients report a diminution of tension, improved bodymovement, and an enhanced feeling of well being.
Research and general acceptance
Aston-Patterning is an outgrowth of Rolfing, whichhas been shown to be of benefit in a limited number ofcontrolled studies. Little controlled research has been doneon the either benefits or limitations of Aston-Patterning. Itsclaims have been neither proven nor disproved, althoughanecdotally many clients report relief from pain and ten-sion and also improved body movement.Resources

JUDITH ASTON
Judith Aston was born in Long Beach, California.She graduated from University of California at Los Ange-les with a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest inmovement arose from working as a dancer. In 1963Aston established her first movement education pro-gram for dancers, actors, and athletes at Long BeachCity College.Five years later, while recovering from injuries sus-tained during two consecutive automobile accidents,Aston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Astonbegan working for Rolf, teaching a movement educationprogram called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning thatemphasized using the body with minimum effort andmaximum precision.In time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movementdiverged, and the partnership was dissolved in 1977.Aston formed her own company called the Aston Para-digm Corporation in Lake Tahoe, California. This com-pany provides training and certification for Aston practi-tioners. She also began exploring how environmentalconditions affect body movement, foreshadowing theergonomic movement in the workplace that developedin the 1990s. Over time, Aston has expanded her move-ment work to include a fitness program for older adults.Today, Judith Aston serves as director of Aston ParadigmCorporation.GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 387hood that progressively destroys part of the motor controlarea of the brain, leading to a lack of balance and coordina-tion. A-T also affects the immune system and increases therisk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals.
Description
The disorder first appeared in the medical literature inthe mid-1920s, but was not named specifically until 1957.The name is a combination of two recognized abnormali-ties: ataxia (lack of muscle control) and telangiectasia(abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result intumors and red skin lesions). However, A-T involves morethan just the sum of these two findings. Other associatedA-T problems include immune system deficiencies,extreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers.Medical researchers initially suspected that multiplegenes (the units responsible for inherited features) wereinvolved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single largegene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers namedthe gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent researchrevealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating celldivision. The symptoms associated with A-T reflect themain role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu-lar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damagedDNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutatedinto ATM, the signaling networks are affected and the cellno longer responds correctly to minimize the damage.A-T is very rare, but it occurs in every populationworld wide, with an estimated frequency of between1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it is believed thatmany A-T cases, particularly those who die at a youngage, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this diseasemay actually be much more prevalent. According to theA-T Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million inthe United States) of the general population carries defec-tive A-T genes. Carriers of one copy of this gene do notdevelop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk ofcancer. This makes the A-T gene one of the most impor-tant cancer-related genes identified to date.
Causes and symptoms
The ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning thedisease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited fromboth parents. Infants with A-T initially often appear veryhealthy. At around age two, ataxia and nervous systemabnormalities becomes apparent. The root cause of A-T-associated ataxia is cell deathin the brain, specificallythe large branching cells of the nervous system (Purkin-je’s cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddlerbecomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks musclecontrol. Speech becomes slurred and more difficult, andthe symptoms progressively worsen. Between ages twoand eight, telangiectases, or tiny, red “spider” veins,appear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes.By age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer controltheir muscles. Immune system deficiencies become com-mon, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive toradiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between indi-viduals but include lower-than-normal levels of proteinsthat function as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and whiteblood cells (blood cells not containing “iron” proteins). Thethymus gland, which aids in development of the body’simmune system, is either missing or has developed abnor-mally. Intelligence is normal, but growth may be retardedowing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies. Indi-viduals with A-T are also sometimes afflicted with dia-betes, prematurely graying hair, and difficulty swallowing.As the children grow older, the immune system becomesweaker and less capable of fighting infection. In the laterstages, recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancers,such as leukemia or lymphoma, are common.Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A-T: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia. However, thismay be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior totelangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symp-toms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% ofindividuals with A-T have a high incidence of respiratoryinfection, 30% do not. The identification of the ATMgene raises hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment,may be possible.
Treatment
There is currently no cure for A-T, and treatmentfocuses on managing the individual’s multiple symp-toms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help thepatient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, orextracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are usedto strengthen the weakened immune system. High-dosevitamin administrations may also be prescribed.Research continues in many countries to find effectivetreatments. Individuals and families living with this dis-order may benefit from attending support groups.
Prognosis
A-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T becomephysically disabled by their early teens and typically dieby their early 20s, usually from the associated blood can-cers and malignancies. In very rare cases, individualswith A-T may experience slower progression and aslightly longer life span, surviving into their 30s. A-Tcarriers have a five-fold higher risk than non-carriers ofdeveloping certain cancers, especially breast cancer.

Medical researchers are investigating methods forscreening individuals who may be carriers of the defec-tive gene. Prenatal testing for A-T is possible but notdone routinely, because commercial screening tests haveyet to be developed.Resources

Atelectasis
Definition
Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue affecting partor all of one lung. This condition prevents normal oxy-gen absoption to healthy tissues.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 389AtelectasisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 389Description
Atelectasis can result from an obstruction (block-age) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called alve-oli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a rich bloodsupply. They are important for lung function, since theirpurpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.When the airways are blocked by a mucous “plug,” for-eign object, or tumor, the alveoli are unable to fill withair and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affectedarea. Atelectasis is a potential complication followingsurgery, especially in individuals who have undergonechest or abdominal operations resulting in associatedabdominal or chest painduring breathing. Congenitalatelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs toexpand at birth. This congenital condition may be local-ized or may affect all of both lungs.
Causes and symptoms
Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attemps atrespiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, orabsence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveolithat maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing thesurface tension of fluids that coat the lung). This lack ofsurfactant reduces the surface area available for effectivegas exchange causing it to collapse if severe. Pressure onthe lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well asobstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resultingfrom various infections and lung diseases. Tumors andinhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway,leading to atelectasis.Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgeryusing general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis,since breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoidpain from the surgical incision. Any significant decreasein airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre-tions, which in turn can cause infection. Chest injuriescausing shallow breathing, including fractured ribs, cancause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasisinclude shortness of breathand decreased chest wallexpansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of thelung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the conditionaffects a large area of the lung and develops quickly, theindividual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extremeshortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on theaffected side. Feverand increased heart rate may be pre-sent if infection accompanies atelectasis.Diagnosis
To diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recordingthe patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys- ical examination. When the doctor listens to the lungsthrough a stethoscope (ausculation), diminished orbronchial breath sounds may be heard. By tapping on thechest (percussion) while listening through the stetho-scope, the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed. Achest x raythat shows an airless area in the lung con-firms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If an obstruction of theairways is suspected, a computed tomography scan (CT)or bronchoscopymay be performed to locate the causeof the blockage.
Treatment
If atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway, thefirst step in treatment is to remove the cause of the block-age. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bron-choscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgerymay be necessary to remove it. Antibioticsare commonlyused to fight the infection that often accompanies atelec-tasis. In cases where recurrent or long-lasting infection isdisabling or where significant bleeding occurs, the affect-ed section of the lung may be surgically removed.
Prognosis
If atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus “plug” orinhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com-pletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by atumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumorinvolved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-oper-ative conditions and/or complications affect the prognosis.

When recovering from surgery, frequent reposi-tioning in bed along with coughing and deep breathingare important. Coughing and breathing deeply everyone to two hours after any surgical operation with gen-eral anesthesia is recommended. Breathing exercisesand the use of breathing devices, such as an incentivespirometer, may also help prevent atelectasis.Although smokers have a higher risk of developingatelectasis following surgery, stopping smokingsix to eight weeks before surgery can help reduce the risk.Increasing fluid intake during respiratory illness orafter surgery (by mouth or intravenously) helps lungsecretions to remain loose. Increasing humidity mayalso be beneficial.Postural drainage techniques can be learned from arespiratory therapist or physical therapist and are a usefultool for anyone affected with a respiratiory illness thatcould cause atelectasis. Because foreign objectsblock- ing the airway can cause atelectasis, it is very importantto keep small objects that might be inhaled away fromyoung children.Resources

Atherectomy
Definition
Atherectomy is a non-surgical procedure to openblocked coronary arteries or vein grafts by using a deviceon the end of a catheter to cut or shave away atheroscle-rotic plaque (a deposit of fat and other substances thataccumulate in the lining of the artery wall).
Purpose
Atherectomy is performed to restore the flow ofoxygen-rich blood to the heart, to relieve chest pain, and to prevent heart attacks. It may be done on patients withchest pain who have not responded to other medical ther-apy and on certain of those who are candidates for bal-loon angioplasty(a surgical procedure in which a bal-loon catheter is used to flatten plaque against an arterywall) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 391AtherectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 391sometimes performed to remove plaque that has built upafter a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Precautions
Atherectomy should not be performed when theplaque is located where blood vessels divide into branch-es, when plaque is angular or inside an angle of a bloodvessel, on patients with weak vessel walls, on ulceratedor calcium-hardened lesions, or on blockages throughwhich a guide wire won’t pass.
Description
Atherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other deviceplaced on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroyplaque. At the beginning of the procedure, medications tocontrol blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries, andprevent blood clots are administered. The patient isawake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an arteryin the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through the bloodvessels into the blocked coronary artery. The cuttinghead is positioned against the plaque and activated, andthe plaque is ground up or suctioned out.The types of atherectomy are rotational, directional,and transluminal extraction. Rotational atherectomy uses ahigh speed rotating shaver to grind up plaque. Directionalatherectomy was the first type approved, but is no longercommonly used; it scrapes plaque into an opening in oneside of the catheter. Transluminal extraction coronaryatherectomy uses a device that cuts plaque off vessel wallsand vacuums it into a bottle. It is used to clear bypass grafts.Performed in a cardiac catheterizationlab, atherec-tomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronaryarteries. It can be used instead of, or along with, balloonangioplasty. Atherectomy is successful about 95% of thetime. Plaque forms again in 20-30% of patients.
Preparation
The day before atherectomy, the patient takes med-ication to prevent blood clots and may be asked to batheand shampoo with an antiseptic skin cleaner.
Aftercare
After the procedure, the patient spends several daysin the hospital’s cardiac monitoring area. For at least 20

For the first hour, an electrocardiogram and closemonitoring are conducted; vital signs are checked every15 minutes. Pain medication is then administered. Thepuncture site is checked once an hour or more. For mostof the first 24 hours, the patient remains in bed.
Risks
Chest pain is the most common complication ofatherectomy. Other common complications are injury tothe blood vessel lining, plaque that re-forms, blood clots(hematoma), and bleeding at the site of insertion. Moreserious but less frequent complications are blood vesselholes, blood vessel wall tears, or reduced blood flow tothe heart.Resources

Atherosclerosis
Definition
Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque onthe inside of blood vessels. In Greek,atheremeans gruel, and sklerosmeans hard.Atherosclerosis is often calledarteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria, meaning artery) is a general term for hardening of thearteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms,including atherosclerosis.
Description
Atherosclerosis, a progressive process responsiblefor most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis orhardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of severallayers: an inner lining called the endothelium, an elasticmembrane that allows the artery to expand and contract,a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of connective tis-sue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hard-ening of the inner and middle layers of the artery. It canbe caused by normal aging, by high blood pressure, andby diseases such as diabetes. Atherosclerosis is a type ofarteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of anartery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that blockthe flow of blood.Plaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,waste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, astringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque forma-tion process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to pro-duce substances that accumulate in the inner layer. Fatbuilds up within these cells and around them, and theyform connective tissue and calcium. The inner layer ofthe artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter is reduced,and blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreased.Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing the suddenformation of a blood clot (thrombosis). Atherosclerosis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 393AtherosclerosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 393can cause a heart attackif it completely blocks theblood flow in the heart (coronary) arteries. It can cause astrokeif it completely blocks the brain (carotid) arteries.Atherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neck,kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing kidney failure or gan- greneand amputation.
Causes and symptoms
Atherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but itusually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some peopleexperience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis duringtheir thirties, others during their fifties or sixties. Athero-sclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still unknown. It isthought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response todamage to the endothelium from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and cigarette smoking. A person who hasall three of these risk factors is eight times more likely todevelop atherosclerosis than is a person who has none.Physical inactivity, diabetes, and obesityare also riskfactors for atherosclerosis. High levels of the amino acidhomocysteine and abnormal levels of protein-coated fatscalled lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary arterydisease. These substances are the targets of much currentresearch. The role of triglycerides, another fat that circu-lates in the blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques isunclear. High levels of triglycerides are often associatedwith diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-densitylipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (“good”)cholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary arterydisease. These risk factors are all modifiable. Non-modi-fiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.Risk factors that can be changed:• Cigarette/tobacco smoke—Smoking increases both thechance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance ofdying from coronary heart disease. Second hand smokemay also increase risk.• High blood cholesterol—Cholesterol, a soft, waxy sub-stance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs, and otheranimal products and is produced in the liver. Age, sex,heredity, and diet affect cholesterol. Total blood choles-terol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL andborderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159mg/dL.• High triglycerides—Most fat in food and in the bodytakes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride lev-els above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronaryartery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however,are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.• High blood pressure—Blood pressure of 140 over 90 orhigher makes the heart work harder, and over time, bothweakens the heart and harms the arteries.• Physical inactivity—Lack of exerciseincreases the riskof atherosclerosis.• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing atheroscle-rosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can belowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most dia-betics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on theheart and increases the risk of developing atherosclero-sis even if no other risk factors are present.Risk factors that cannot be changed:• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary arterydisease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are atincreased risk. The high rate of severe hypertensionamong African-Americans puts them at increased risk.• Sex—Before age 60, men are more likely to have heartattacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is equalamong men and women.• Age—Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age andolder and women who are 55 years of age and older.Symptoms differ depending upon the location of theatherosclerosis.• In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart attack,or sudden death.• In the carotid (brain) arteries: Sudden dizziness, weak- ness, loss of speech, or blindness.• In the femoral (leg) arteries: Disease of the blood ves-sels in the outer parts of the body (peripheral vasculardisease) causes cramping and fatiguein the calveswhen walking.• In the renal (kidney) arteries: High blood pressure thatis difficult to treat.
Diagnosis
Physicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero-sclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stetho-scope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand (pal-pation). More definite tests are electrocardiography, echocardiographyor ultrasonography of the arteries (forexample, the carotids), radionuclide scans, and angiogra-phy.An electrocardiogram shows the heart’s activity. Elec-trodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on thepatient’s body. They send impulses of the heart to arecorder. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performedin a physician’s office. Exercise electrocardiography ( stress test) is conducted while the patient exercises on a treadmill

It is performed in a physician’s office oran exercise laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes.Echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, uses soundwaves to create an image of the heart’s chambers andvalves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transduc-er, presses it against the patient’s chest, and images aredisplayed on a monitor. This technique cannot evaluatethe coronary arteries directly. They are too small and arein motion with the heart. Severe coronary artery disease,however, may cause abnormal heart motion that isdetected by echocardiography. Performed in a cardiologyoutpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30-60minutes. Ultrasonography is also used to assess arteriesof the neck and thighs.Radionuclide angiography and thallium (or ses-tamibi) scanning enable physicians to see the blood flowthrough the coronary arteries and the heart chambers.Radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream. Adevice that uses gamma rays to produce an image of theradioactive material (gamma camera) records pictures ofthe heart. Radionuclide angiography is usually performedin a hospital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30-60 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done after anexercise stresstest or after injection of a vasodilator, adrug to enlarge the blood vessels, like dipyridamole (Per-santine). Thallium is injected, and the scan is done thenand again four hours (and possibly 24 hours) later. Thalli-um scanning is usually performed in a hospital’s nuclearmedicine department. Each scan takes 30-60 minutes.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 395Atherosclerosis
The result is a fibrous lesion, made up in partof muscle cells, proteins, and collagen, that has at its center a pool of lipids and dead cells. Blood flow can be very nearly cut off by the blockage.
When the arterial lining becomes separated over the growing mass of foam cells, platelets are attracted to the site and begin the process of clot formation.PlateletsHigh cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, viruses,cigarette smoking, etc., cause injuries to the lining of the artery, creating areas where higher levels of lipidsare trapped.
Further injury is inflicted by foam cellsattempting to remove lipids back to thelungs, liver, spleen and lymph nodesby again passing through the lining ofthe artery.Monocyte Lining ofartery MuscleT -cell
Monocytes (the largest of the white blood cells) and T -cells are attracted to the injury.

(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 395Coronary angiography is the most accurate diagnos-tic method and the only one that requires entering thebody (invasive procedure). A cardiologist inserts acatheter equipped with a viewing device into a blood ves-sel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart. Thepatient has been given a contrast dye that makes the heartvisible to x rays. Motion pictures are taken of the con-trast dye flowing though the arteries. Plaques and block-ages, if present, are well defined. The patient is awakebut has been given a sedative. Coronary angiography isperformed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory andtakes from 30 minutes to two hours.
Treatment
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, lipid-loweringdrugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Atherosclerosisrequires lifelong care.Patients who have less severe atherosclerosis mayachieve adequate control through lifestyle changes anddrug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that preventdisease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, los-ing weight (if necessary), exercise, controlling bloodpressure, and not smoking—also help prevent the disease.Most of the drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis seekto lower cholesterol. Many popular lipid-lowering drugscan reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average of 25-30%when combined with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.Lipid-lowering drugs include bile acid resins, “statins”(drugs that effect HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme thatcontrols the processing of cholesterol), niacin, and fibricacid derivatives such as gemfibrozil (Lobid). Aspirin helps prevent thrombosis and a variety of other medica-tions can be used to treat the effects of atherosclerosis.Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty andbypass surgery are invasive procedures that improveblood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous translu-minal coronary angioplasty (coronary angioplasty) is anon-surgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with aballoon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh intothe blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compresses theplaque to enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blockedartery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiolo-gist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital stay ofone or two days. It is successful about 90% of the time,but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again with-in six months. It can be repeated and a “stent” may beplaced in the artery to help keep it open (see below).In coronary artery bypass surgery (bypass surgery),a detour is built around the blockage with a healthy veinor artery, which then supplies oxygen-rich blood to theheart. It is major surgery appropriate for patients withblockages in two or three major coronary arteries orseverely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and forthose who have not responded to other treatments. It isperformed in a hospital under general anesthesia anduses a heart-lung machine. About 70% of patients experi-ence full relief; about 20% partial relief.Three other semi-experimental surgical proceduresmay be used to treat atherosclerosis. In atherectomy,a cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque fromthe blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with alaser tip is inserted to burn or break down the plaque. Ametal coil called a stent may be permanently implantedto keep a blocked artery open.
Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies that focus on diet and lifestylecan help prevent, retard, or reverse atherosclerosis. Herbaltherapies that may be helpful include: hawthorn ( Cratae- gus laevigata), notoginseng root (Panax notoginseng), garlic (Allium sativum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), hot red or chili peppers, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and alfalfa (Medicago sativum). Relaxation techniquesincluding yoga,meditation,guided imagery,biofeed- back, and counseling and other “talking” therapies mayalso be useful to prevent or slow the progress of the dis-ease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that arelow in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar,and animal proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants(found in fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use ofonions and garlic is recommended, as is eating raw andcooked fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon.Smoking, alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should beavoided. Chelation therapy, which uses anticoagulantdrugs and nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it throughthe kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can beprescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine, which combines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise,and homeopathy, which treats a disease with small dosesof a drug that causes the symptoms of the disease.
Prognosis
Atherosclerosis can be successfully treated but notcured. Recent clinical studies have shown that athero-sclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed byaggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostictechniques enable physicians to identify and treat athero-sclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies and sur-gical procedures have extended the lives of many patientswho would otherwise have died. Research continues.

A healthy lifestyle—eating right, regular exercise,maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and control-ling hypertension—can reduce the risk of developingatherosclerosis, help keep the disease from progressing,and sometimes cause it to regress.• Eat right-A healthy diet reduces excess levels of LDLcholesterol and triglycerides. It includes a variety offoods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high infiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited sodi-um. Fat should comprise no more than 30%, and saturat-ed fat no more than 8-10%, of total daily caloriesaccording to the American Heart Association. Choles-terol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per dayand sodium to about 2,400 milligrams. The “FoodGuide” Pyramid developed by the U.S. Departments ofAgriculture and Health and Human Services providesdaily guidelines: 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, andpasta; 3-5 servings of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit;2-3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 serv-ings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.Fats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono-unsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) aregood alternatives to use for cooking.• Exercise regularly—Aerobic exercise can lower bloodpressure, help control weight, and increase HDL(“good”) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vesselsmore flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exerciselasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exerciseperiods) four or more times per week is recommended,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention and the American College of Sports Medicine.Aerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, andcycling, active gardening, climbing stairs, or briskhousework. A physician should be consulted beforeexercise if a person has atherosclerosis or is atincreased risk for it.• Maintain a desirable body weight—Losing weight canhelp reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce triglyc-erides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It may also reduceblood pressure. Eating right and exercising are two keycomponents in maintaining a desirable body weight.• Do not smoke or use tobacco—Smoking has manyadverse effects on the heart but quitting can repairdamage. Ex-smokers face the same risk of heart dis-ease as non-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting.Smoking is the worst thing a person can do to theirheart and lungs.• Seek treatment for hypertension—High blood pressurecan be controlled through lifestyle changes—reducingsodium and fat, exercising, managing stress, quittingKEY TERMS
Arteriosclerosis—Hardening of the arteries. Itincludes atherosclerosis, but the two terms areoften used synonymously.Cholesterol—A fat-like substance that is made bythe human body and eaten in animal products.Cholesterol is used to form cell membranes andprocess hormones and vitamin D. High choles-terol levels contribute to the development of ath-erosclerosis.HDL Cholesterol—About one-third or one-fourthof all cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein cho-lesterol.

Athlete’s foot
Definition
A common fungus infection between the toes inwhich the skin becomes itchy and sore, cracking andpeeling away. Athlete’s foot (also known as tinea pedis orfoot ringworm) can be treated, but it can be tenaciousand difficult to clear up completely.
Description
Athlete’s foot is a very common condition of itchy,peeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common that mostpeople will have at least one episode at least once in theirlives. It’s less often found in women and children underage 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in youngchildren most probably are caused by some other skincondition).Because the fungi grow well in warm, damp areas,they flourish in and around swimming pools, showers,and locker rooms. Tinea pedis got its common namebecause the infection was common among athletes whooften used these areas.
Causes and symptoms
Athlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection thatmost often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs. Trichophy-ton rubrum,T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floc-cosum, the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual inthat they live exclusively on dead body tissue (hair, theouter layer of skin, and nails). The fungus grows best inmoist, damp, dark places with poor ventilation. The prob-lem doesn’t occur among people who usually go barefoot.Many people carry the fungus on their skin. Howev-er, it will only flourish to the point of causing athlete’sfoot if conditions are right. Many people believe athlete’sfoot is highly contagious, especially in public swimmingpools and shower rooms. Research has shown, however,that it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walk-ing barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactlywhy some people develop the condition and others don’tis not well understood.Sweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’tabsorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying thefeet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute to theovergrowth of the fungus.Symptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skinon the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, andblisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of tis-sue, can cause painand swelling. As the infectionspreads,itchingand burning may get worse.If it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to thesoles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infectionsmay appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling andthickened nails, and nail loss. The infection can spreadfurther if patients scratch and then touch themselves else-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 398Athlete’s footGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 398where (especially in the groin or under the arms). It’s alsopossible to spread the infection to other parts of the bodyvia contaminated bed sheets or clothing.
Diagnosis
Not all foot rashesare athlete’s foot, which is why aphysician should diagnose the condition before anyremedies are used. Using nonprescription products on arash that is not athlete’s foot could make the rash worse.A dermatologist can diagnose the condition byphysical examinationand by examining a preparationof skin scrapings under a microscope. This test, called aKOH preparation, treats a sample of tissue scraped fromthe infected area with heat and potassium hydroxide(KOH). This treatment dissolves certain substances inthe tissue sample, making it possible to see the fungiunder the microscope.
Treatment
Athlete’s foot may be resistant to medication andshould not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond wellto antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketocona-zole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or tolnaf-tate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, thedoctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug.Untreated athlete’s foot may lead to a secondarybacterial infection in the skin cracks.
Alternative treatment
A footbath containing cinnamon has been shown toslow down the growth of certain molds and fungi, and issaid to be very effective in clearing up athlete’s foot. Tomake the bath:• heat four cups of water to a boil• add eight to 10 broken cinnamon sticks• reduce heat and simmer five minutes• remove and let the mixture steep for 45 minutes untillukewarm• soak feetOther herbal remedies used externally to treat ath-lete’s foot include: a foot soak or powder containinggoldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis); tea tree oil (Melaleu- caspp.); or calendula (Calendula officinalis) cream tohelp heal cracked skin.Prognosis
Athlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment,but it is important to take all medication as directed by adermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of fun-gus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenailinfections that may accompany athlete’s foot, however,are typically very hard to treat effectively
Prevention
Good personal hygiene and a few simple precautionscan help prevent athlete’s foot. To prevent spread of ath-lete’s foot:• wash feet daily• dry feet thoroughly (especially between toes)• avoid tight shoes (especially in summer)• wear sandals during warm weather• wear cotton socks and change them often if they getdamp• don’t wear socks made of synthetic material• go barefoot outdoors when possible• wear bathing shoes in public bathing or showeringareas• use a good quality foot powder• don’t wear sneakers without socks• wash towels, contaminated floors, and shower stallswell with hot soapy water if anyone in the family hasathlete’s footResources

Athletic heart syndrome
Definition
Athletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of an ath-lete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses of strenu-ous physical training. It can be difficult to distinguish asignificant medical condition from an athletic heart.
Description
The heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging,especially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases thecardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with eachbeat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation dependson the nature of the physical demand. There are twotypes of demand, static and dynamic. Static demandinvolves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resis-tance for brief period. An example is weight lifting.Dynamic training involves larger groups of muscles atlower resistance for extended periods of time. Examplesare aerobic training and tennis. Cardiac enlargement isassociated with dynamic training. The heart’s response tostatic training is hypertrophy, thickening of the musclewalls of the heart. As the wall of the heart adapts, thereare changes in the electrical conducting system of theheart. Because of the larger volume of blood beingpumped with each heart beat, the heart rate when at restdecreases below the normal level for nonathletes.Sudden unexpected death(SUD) is the death of anathlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity.Often, there is no warning that the person will experienceSUD, although in some cases, warning signs appearwhich cause the person to seek medical advice. Impor-tantly, cases of death occurring during physical activityare not caused by athletic heart syndrome, but by undiag-nosed heart disorders.
Causes and symptoms
Athletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a nor-mal adaptation by the heart to increased physical activity.The changes in the electrical conduction system of theheart may be pronounced and diagnostic, but should notcause problems. In the case of SUD, other heart prob-lems are involved. In 85-97% of the cases of SUD, anunderlying structural defect of the heart has been noted.
Diagnosis
The changes in the heart beat caused by the electri-cal conduction system of the heart are detectable on anelectrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in athleticheart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseases.Careful examination must be made to distinguish heartdisease from athletic heart syndrome.
Prognosis
The yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people lessthan 35 years of age is less than seven incidents per100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise related. On a national basis, this means that each yearapproximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In personsover age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55 in100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring duringexercise.Resources

Atkins diet
Definition
The Atkins diet is a high-protein, high-fat, and verylow-carbohydrate regimen. It emphasizes meat, cheese,and eggs, while discouraging foods such as bread, pasta,fruit, and sugar. It is a form of ketogenic diet.
Purpose
The primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substan-tial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate intake, thebody will burn more fat stored in the body. Since there areno limits on the amount of calories or quantities of foodsallowed on the diet, there is little hunger between meals.According to Atkins, the diet can alleviate symptoms of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 400Athletic heart syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 400conditions such as fatigue, irritability, headaches, depres-sion, and some types of joint and muscle pain.
Description
The regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenicdiet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usuallydue to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of car-bohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen loss,which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect. Long-term weight loss occurs because with a low amount ofcarbohydrate intake, the body burns stored fat for energy.The four-step diet starts with a two-week inductionprogram designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo-lism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowedbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams perday. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry, fish,eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of carbohy-drates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegeta-bles, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery.The second stage is for ongoing weight loss. Itallows 15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When theindividual is about 10 pounds from their desired weight,they begin the pre-maintenance phase. This graduallyadds one to three servings a week of high carbohydratefoods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheatbread. When the desired weight is reached, the mainte-nance stage begins. It allows 40-60 grams of carbohy-drates per day.Opinion from the general medical communityremains mixed on the Atkins diet, but is generally unfa-vorable. There have been no significant long-term scien-tific studies on the diet. A number of leading medical andhealth organizations, including the American MedicalAssociation, American Dietetic Association (ADA), andthe American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastical-ly different than the dietary intakes recommended by theU.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Insti-tutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because thediet is lacking in some vitaminsand nutrients, andbecause it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S. Con-gress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representativecalled the Atkins diet “hazardous” and said it lacked sci-entific credibility.

DR. ROBERT C. ATKINS (1930– )
Dr. Robert C. Atkins graduated from the Universityof Michigan in 1951 and received his medical degreefrom Cornell University Medical School in 1955 with aspecialty in cardiology. As an internist and cardiologisthe developed the Atkins Diet in the early 1970s. The dietis a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and verylow carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha-sizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foodssuch as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub-lic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution. The book quickly became a bestsellerbut unlike most other fad diet books, this one hasremained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28times and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.Since then, Atkins has authored a number of other bookson his diet theme, including Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revo-lution(1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New DietCookbook(1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution:Nature’s Answer to Drugs(1998).Atkins has seen about 60,000 patients in his morethan 30 years of practice. He has also appeared on numer-ous radio and television talk shows, has his own syndicat-ed radio program, Your Health Choices, and authors themonthly newsletter Dr. Atkins’ Health Revelations. Atkins has received the World Organization of Alternative Medi-cine’s Recognition of Achievement Award and beennamed the National Health Federation’s Man of the Year.He is director of the Atkins Center for ComplementaryMedicine which he founded in the early 1980s. The centeris located at 152 E. 55th St., New York, NY 10022.
(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 401Preparations
No advance preparation is needed to go on the diet.However, as with most diets, it is generally consideredappropriate to consult with a physician and to have aphysical evaluation before starting such a nutritional reg-imen. The evaluation should include blood tests to deter-mine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin,and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test is also recom-mended.
Precautions
Adherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitaminand mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-mends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, includ-ing a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,Atkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600micrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400 mil-ligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium, and450-675 mcg of biotin.The diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari-ans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro-tein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannotfollow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy-drates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends veg-etarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari- anism, or at least include fish in their diet.
Side effects
According to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse sideeffects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a factsheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site(http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti-cian and author, said the diet may have serious sideeffects for some people. She said complications associat-ed with the diet include ketosis,dehydration, electrolyteloss, calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidneyproblems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu-als with medical problems such as heart disease, hyper- tension, kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over-weight people with no health problems,” she said.People with diabetes taking insulin are at risk ofbecoming hypoglycemic if they do not eat appropriatecarbohydrates. Also, persons who exerciseregularly mayexperience low energy levels and muscle fatigue fromlow carbohydrate intake.Resources

Atopic dermatitis
Definition
Eczema is a general term used to describe a varietyof conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin rash.Atopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, is a non-conta-gious disorder characterized by chronically inflamedskin and sometimes intolerable itching.
Description
Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseasesthat are often associated with stressand allergic disor-ders that involve the respiratory system, like asthmaand hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis can appear at anyage, it is most common in children and young adults.Symptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do notaffect the patient’s general health.About one in ten babies develop a form of atopicdermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skinthat oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema mostoften occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usuallyimproves before the child’s second birthday, and medicalattention can keep symptoms in check until that time.When atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,inflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are lesspronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn fromred to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and becomescaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition cancause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching asso-ciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It canbe so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleed,sometimes causing scarring and infection.Atopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the populationof the United States, and about 80% of the people whohave the condition have one or more relatives with thesame condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to bemost severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt onany part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches onthe fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last foryears. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitisoften appears on one or more of the following areas:• elbow creases• backs of the knees
• ankles• wrists• face• neck• upper chest• palms and between the fingers
Causes and symptoms
While allergic reactions often trigger atopic dermati-tis, the condition is thought to be the result of an inherit-ed over-active immune system or a genetic defect thatcauses the skin to lose abnormally large amounts ofmoisture. The condition can be aggravated by a cycle thatdevelops in which the skin itches, the patient scratches,the condition worsens, the itching worsens, the patientscratches, etc. This cycle must be broken by relieving theitching to allow the skin time to heal. If the skin becomes

Expo- sure to any of the following can cause a flare-up:• hot or cold temperatures• wool and synthetic fabrics• detergents, fabric softeners, and chemicals• use of drugs that suppress immune-system activityCertain foods, such as peanuts, cow’s milk, eggs,and fish, can trigger symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Asmall percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis findthat their symptoms worsen after having been exposed todust, feather pillows, rough-textured fabrics, or othermaterials to which dust adheres.Diagnosis
Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based onthe patient’s symptoms and personal and family healthhistory. Skin tests do not generally provide reliable infor-mation about this condition.
Treatment
Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured, but the severityand duration of symptoms can be controlled. A dermatol-ogist should be consulted when symptoms first appear,and is likely to recommend warm baths to loosenencrusted skin, followed by applications of petroleumjelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skin’s naturalmoisture from escaping.Externally applied (topical) steroids or preparationscontaining coal tar can relieve minor itching, but coal tarhas an unpleasant odor, stains clothes, and may increaseskin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid creams inyoung children can alter growth. Pregnant women shouldnot use products that contain coal tar. Topical steroids cancause itching, burning,acne, permanent stretch marks,and thinning and spotting of the skin. Applying topicalsteroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma. Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine(Benadryl), can relieve symptoms of allergy-related atopicdermatitis. More concentrated topical steroids are recom-mended for persistent symptoms. A mild tranquilizer maybe prescribed to reduce stress and help the patient sleep,and antibioticsare used to treat secondary infections.Cortisone ointments should be used sparingly, andstrong preparations should never be applied to the face,groin, armpits, or rectal area. Regular medical monitor-ing is recommended for patients who use cortisonesalves or lotions to control wide-spread symptoms. Oralcortisone may be prescribed if the patient does notrespond to other treatments, but patients who take themedication for more than two weeks have a greater-than-average risk of developing severe symptoms when thetreatment is discontinued.Allergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis andsometimes aggravate the symptoms. Since food allergiesmay trigger atopic dermatitis, the doctor may suggest
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 404Atopic dermatitis
Infant Adult
Atopic dermatitis can erupt on any part of the skin. Ininfants, it often appears on the face, scalp, and knees, whileit develops on the elbows, neck, back of the knees, andankles in adults.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 404eliminating certain foods from the diet if other treatmentsprove ineffective.If symptoms are extremely severe, ultraviolet lighttherapy may be prescribed, and a wet body wrap recom-mended to help the skin retain moisture. This technique,used most often with children, involves sleeping in awarm room while wearing wet pajamas under dry cloth-ing, rain gear, or a nylon sweatsuit. The patient’s face maybe covered with wet gauze covered by elastic bandages,and his hands encased in wet socks covered by dry ones.A physician should be notified if the condition iswidespread or resists treatment, or the skin oozes,becomes encrusted, or smells, as this may indicate aninfection.
Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies can sometimes bring relief orresolution of atopic dermatitis when conventional thera-pies are not helping. If the condition becomes increas-ingly widespread or infected, a physician should be con-sulted.Helpful alternative treatments for atopic dermatitismay include:• Taking regular brisk walks, followed by bathing inwarm water sprinkled with essential oil of lavender(Lavandula officinalis); lavender oil acts as a nerverelaxant for the whole body including the skin• Supplementing the diet daily with zinc, fish oils, vita-min A, vitamin E, and evening primrose oil (Oenotherabiennis)—all good sources of nutrients for the skin• Reducing or eliminating red meat from the diet• Eliminating or rotating potentially allergic foods suchas cow’s milk, peanuts, wheat, eggs, and soy• Implementing stress reductiontechniques in daily life.Herbal therapies also can be helpful in treatingatopic dermatitis. Western herbal remedies used in thetreatment of this condition include burdock ( Arctium lappa) and Ruta(Ruta graveolens). Long-term herbaltherapy requires monitoring and should be guided by anexperienced practitioner.Other alternative techniques that may be useful inthe treatment of atopic dermatitis include:• Acupressure (acupuncturewithout needles) to relievetension that may trigger a flare• Aromatherapy, using essential oils like lavender, thyme(Thymus vulgaris), jasmine (Jasminum officinale) and chamomile (Matricaria recutita) in hot water, to add asoothing fragrance to the airKEY TERMS
Corticosteroid—A steroid hormone produced bythe adrenal gland or as a synthetic compoundthat reduces inflammation, redness, rashes, andirritation.Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.• Shiatsu massage and reflexology, performed bylicensed practitioners, to alleviate symptoms by restor-ing the body’s natural balance• Homeopathy, which may temporarily worsen symp-toms before relieving them, and should be supervisedby a trained alternative healthcare professional• Hydrotherapy, which uses water, ice, liquid, and steam,to stimulate the immune system• Juice therapy to purify the liver and relieve bowel con-gestion• Yoga to induce a sense of serenity.
Prognosis
Atopic dermatitis is unpredictable. Although symp-toms occur less often with age and sometimes disappearaltogether, they can recur without warning. Atopic der-matitis lowers resistance to infection and increases therisk of developing cataracts. Sixty percent of patientswith atopic dermatitis will experience flares and remis-sions throughout their lives.
Prevention
Research has shown that babies weaned from breastmilk before they are four months old are almost threetimes more likely than other babies to develop recurrenteczema. Feeding eggs or fish to a baby less than one yearold can activate symptoms, and babies should be shieldedfrom such irritants as mites, molds, pet hair, and smoke.Possible ways to prevent flare-ups include the fol-lowing:• eliminate activities that cause sweating• lubricate the skin frequently• avoid wool, perfumes, fabric softeners, soaps that drythe skin, and other irritants• avoid sudden temperature changes.A doctor should be notified whenever any of the fol-lowing occurs:• fever or relentless itching develop during a flare

Atrial ectopic beats
Definition
Atrial ectopic beats (AEB) refers to a contraction ofthe upper heart chamber which occurs before it would beexpected. Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema-ture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri-al extrasystole.
Description
An AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in thenormal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional-ly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequenceand then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware ofthe event.
Causes and symptoms
As people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre-quently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB maybe triggered or increased by stress,caffeine,smoking, and some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrineor pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci-dence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the resultof an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reducedblood supply to that area of the heart.If a person is aware of the event, the first symptomof AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped ormissed a beat. This is often accompanied by a feelingthat the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest. Thethumping or pounding is caused by the fact that whenthere is an AEB, the pause before the next beat is usuallylonger than normal. The next beat must be stronger thanusual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis ofthe patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocar-diogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECGshows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first waveis called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. Anatrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wavethat occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave.
Treatment
Atrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment.If treatment is necessary because the beats occur fre-quently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor mayprescribe medication.
Prognosis
Occasional AEB usually have no significance. Ifthey increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial tachy-cardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac output.

Definition
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are abnormal heartrhythms in which the atria, or upper chambers of the heart,are out of sync with the ventricles, or lower chambers ofthe heart. In atrial fibrillation, the atria “quiver” chaotical-ly and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, theatria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles.
Description
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiacarrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s rhythm. Nearly2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according tothe American Heart Association. It is the most commonchronic arrhythmia. Atrial flutter is less common, butboth of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to formin the heart. This can lead to a strokeor a blockage car-ried by the blood flow (an embolism) anywhere in thebody’s arteries. Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about15% of strokes.The atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. Inatrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular.The atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularly;the ventricles, the heart’s two large lower chambers, beatirregularly but not as fast as the atria. When the atria fibril-late, blood that is not completely pumped out can pool andform a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is usually veryfast but steady. The atria beat faster than the ventricles.Atrial fibrillation often occurs in people with varioustypes of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also resultfrom an inflammation of the heart’s covering (pericardi-tis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and cer-tain medications. Atrial fibrillation is more common inolder people; about 10% of people over the age of 75have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in peo-ple with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and othertypes of heart disorders.
Causes and symptoms
In most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut-ter can be found, but often it cannot. Causes of theseheart beat abnormalities include:• many types of heart disease•stressand anxiety•caffeine• alcohol• tobacco• diet pills• some prescription and over-the-counter medications• open heart surgerySymptoms, when present, include:• a fluttering feeling in the chest• a pulse that feels like the heart is skipping, racing, jump-ing, or is irregular• low energy• a faint or dizzy feeling• pressure or discomfort in the chest• shortness of breath• anxiety.
Diagnosis
A doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmiasusing an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to thesounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter areusually diagnosed through electrocardiography(EKGs), an exercisestress test, a 24-hour Holter EKGmonitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An EKG showsthe heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen(ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly areplaced on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. The elec-trodes send impulses of the heart’s activity through amonitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that tracesthe pattern of the impulses onto paper. The test takesabout 10 minutes and is performed in a doctor’s office.The exercise stress test measures how the heart and bloodvessels respond to work when the patient is exercising ona treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed ina doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and takes15-30 minutes.In 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the patientwears a small, portable tape recorder connected to diskson his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm duringnormal activities. An EKG called transtelephonic moni-toring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently.Like Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoringcontinues for days or weeks and enables patients to sendthe EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when anarrhythmia is felt, or to store the information in therecorder and transmit it later. Doctors can also use high-frequency sound waves (echocardiography) to deter-mine the structure and function of the heart. This diag-nostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlyingheart disease.
Treatment
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated withmedications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion). In
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 407Atrial fibrillation and flutterGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 407some cases, removal of a small portion of the heart (abla-tion), implantation of a pacemaker or a cardioverterdefibrillator, or maze surgery is needed.If the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled, electri-cal cardioversion may be used. Cardioversion, the elec-tric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emer-gencies. This device briefly suspends the heart’s activityand allows it to return to a normal rhythm.Ablation destroys the heart tissue that causes thearrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheteriza-tion or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation, per- formed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory, cancure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fib-rillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin tubecalled a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threadedinto the heart. At the end of the catheter, a device mapsthe electrical pathways of the heart. A cardiologist, adoctor specializing in the heart, uses this map to identifythe pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia, and then elimi-nates it (them) with bursts of high-frequency radiowaves. Surgical ablation is performed in an operatingroom under general anesthesia. Computerized mappingtechniques are combined with a cold probe to destroyarrhythmia-causing tissue. Ablation is generally suc-cessful. When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it isusually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as wellas drug therapy.A pacemaker is a battery-powered device about thesize of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near thecollarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires thread-ed to the right side of the heart supply electrical energyto pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable car-dioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhyth-mias. The battery-powered device senses an abnormalheart rhythm and automatically provides electricalshock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and thenallows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire elec-trodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some ofthe electrodes are attached to the outside of the heartand some are attached to the inside of the heart throughveins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrilla-tors can be implanted in the chest wall and do notrequire open chest surgery. These devices weigh lessthan 10 oz and generally last seven or eight years. Animplantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually usedwith drug therapy, but the amount medication isreduced. In maze surgery, often the last resort, surgeonscreate a maze of stitches (sutures) that help the heart’selectrical impulses travel effectively.Most of the drugs used for treatment have poten-tial side effects and should be carefully monitored bya doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rateand rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formationof blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heartdisease, the heart disease will also be treated. TheAmerican Heart Association recommends aggressivetreatment.A digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is usuallyprescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis drugsslow the heart’s electrical impulses, helping to restore the nor-mal rate and rhythm. These drugs also increase the abili-ty of the heart’s muscular layer to contract and pumpproperly. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockerscan also be used for this purpose. Beta-blockers slow thespeed of electrical impulses through the heart. Some cal-cium channel blockers dampen the heart’s response toerratic electrical impulses.To prevent blood clots,aspirinor warfarin(Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, haspotential bleeding side effects, especially in olderpatients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter.This drug is often able to maintain the heart’s properrhythm and can also help control the heart rate when theflutter occurs.
Prognosis
Patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live anormal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia iscontrolled and serious blood clots are prevented.
Prevention
Atrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre-vented when the cause can be identified and controlled.Depending on the cause, prevention could include:• treating the underlying heart disease• reducing stress and anxiety• reducing or stopping consumption of caffeine, alcohol,or tobacco; and/or• discontinuing diet pills or other medications (over-the-counter or prescription)Resources

Atrial flutter seeAtrial fibrillation and flutterKEY TERMS
Arrhythmia—A variation in the normal rhythm ofthe heart beat. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are twotypes of arrhythmia.Atria—The two small upper chambers of the heartthat receive blood from the lungs and the body.Stroke—A brain attack caused by a sudden disrup-tion of blood flow to the brain, in this casebecause of a blood clot.Ventricles—The two large lower chambers of theheart that pump blood to the lungs and to the restof the body.Atrial septal defect
Definition
An atrial septal defect is an abnormal opening in thewall separating the left and right upper chambers (atria)of the heart.
Description
During the normal development of the fetal heart,there is an opening in the wall (the septum) separatingthe left and right upper chambers of the heart. Normally,this opening closes before birth, but if it does not, thechild is born with a hole between the left and right atria.This abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defectand causes blood from the left atrium to flow into theright atrium.Different types of atrial septal defects can occur, andthey are classified according to where in the separatingwall they are found. The most commonly found atrialseptal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septumand accounts for about 70% of all atrial septal defects.Abnormal openings can form in the upper and lowerparts of the atrial septum as well.
Causes and symptoms
Abnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur-ing fetal development and are twice as common infemales as in males. These abnormalities can go unno-ticed if the opening is small, producing no abnormalsymptoms. If the defect is big, large amounts of bloodflowing from the left to the right atrium will cause theright atrium to swell to hold the extra blood.People born with an atrial septal defect can have nosymptoms through their twenties, but by age 40, mostpeople with this condition have symptoms that caninclude shortness of breath, rapid abnormal beating ofthe atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually heart failure.
Diagnosis
Atrial septal defects can be identified by variousmethods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the heartbeats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart witha stethoscope. In addition, a chest x ray, an electrocar-diogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heartbeats),and an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves toform a detailed image of the heart) can also be used toidentify this condition.An atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by usinga test called cardiac catheterization. This test involves
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 409Atrial septal defectGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 409inserting a very thin tube (catheter) into the heart’s cham-bers to measure the amount of oxygen present in theblood within the heart. If the heart has an openingbetween the atria, oxygen-rich blood from the left atriumenters the right atrium. Through cardiac catheterization,doctors can detect the higher-than-normal amount of oxy-gen in the heart’s right atrium, right ventricle, and thelarge blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, wherethe blood would normally subsequently get its oxygen.
Treatment
Atrial septal defects often correct themselves withoutmedical treatments by the age of two. If this dose not hap-pen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed, or bysewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of the sac thatsurrounds the heart (the pericardium), over the opening.Some patients can have the defect fixed by having anclam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This plug is aman-made device that is put in place through a catheterinserted into the heart.
Prognosis
Individuals with small defects can live a normal life,but larger defects require surgical correction. Less than1% of people younger than 45 years of age die from cor-rective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients can diefrom the surgery if they are older than 40 and have otherheart-related problems. When an atrial septal defect iscorrected within the first 20 years of life, there is anexcellent chance for the individual to live normally.Resources

Attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD)
Definition
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isa developmental disorder characterized by distractibility,hyperactivity, impulsive behaviors, and the inability toremain focused on tasks or activities.
Description
ADHD, also known as hyperkinetic disorder (HKD)outside of the United States, is estimated to affect 3-9%of children, and afflicts boys more often than girls.Although difficult to assess in infancy and toddlerhood,signs of ADHD may begin to appear as early as age twoor three, but the symptom picture changes as adolescenceapproaches. Many symptoms, particularly hyperactivity,diminish in early adulthood, but impulsivity and inatten-tion problems remain with up to 50% of ADHD individu-als throughout their adult life.Children with ADHD have short attention spans,becoming easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks.Although they may be quite intelligent, their lack of focusfrequently results in poor grades and difficulties in school.ADHD children act impulsively, taking action first andthinking later. They are constantly moving, running,climbing, squirming, and fidgeting, but often have troublewith gross and fine motor skills and, as a result, may be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 410Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 410physically clumsy and awkward. Their clumsiness mayextend to the social arena, where they are sometimesshunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of ADHD are not known. However, itappears that heredity plays a major role in the develop-ment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sib-ling are more likely to develop the disorder themselves.Before birth, ADHD children may have been exposed topoor maternal nutrition, viral infections, or maternalsubstance abuse. In early childhood, exposure to lead orother toxins can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumaticbrain injury or neurological disorders may also triggerADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD isnot known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters,the chemicals in the brain that transmit messagesbetween nerve cells, is believed to be the mechanismbehind ADHD symptoms.A widely publicized study conducted by Dr. BenFeingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergiesto certain foods and food additives caused the characteristichyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some chil-dren may have adverse reactions to certain foods that canaffect their behavior (for example, a rash might tem-porarily cause a child to be distracted from other tasks),carefully controlled follow-up studies have uncovered nolink between food allergies and ADHD. Another popular-ly held misconception about food and ADHD is that theconsumption of sugar causes hyperactive behavior.Again, studies have shown no link between sugar intakeand ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri-tionally balanced diet is important for normal develop-ment in allchildren.Psychologists and other mental health professionalstypically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta-tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV)as a guideline for determining the presence ofADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD,DSM-IVrequires thepresence of at least six of the following symptoms ofinattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivityand impulsivity combined:Inattention:• fails to pay close attention to detail or makes carelessmistakes in schoolwork or other activities• has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities• does not appear to listen when spoken to• does not follow through on instructions and does notfinish tasks• has difficulty organizing tasks and activities• avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mentaleffort (e.g., homework)• is easily distracted• is forgetful in daily activitiesHyperactivity:• fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat• does not remain seated when expected to• runs or climbs excessively when inappropriate (in ado-lescence and adults, feelings of restlessness)• has difficulty playing quietly• is constantly on the move• talks excessivelyImpulsivity:• blurts out answers before the question has been com-pleted• has difficulty waiting for his or her turn• interrupts and/or intrudes on othersDSM-IValso requires that some symptoms developbefore age seven, and that they significantly impair func-tioning in two or more settings (e.g., home and school)for a period of at least six months. Children who meet thesymptom criteria for inattention, but not for hyperactivi-ty/impulsivity are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type,commonly called ADD. (Young girls with ADHD maynot be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtypeof the disorder.)
Diagnosis
The first step in determining if a child has ADHD isto consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can makean initial evaluation of the child’s developmental maturi-ty compared to other children in his or her age group.The physician should also perform a comprehensivephysical examinationto rule out any organic causes ofADHD symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid orvision or hearing problems.If no organic problem can be found, a psychologist,psychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learningspecialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehen-sive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family,social, psychiatric, and educational history is compiledfrom existing medical and school records and frominterviews with parents and teachers. Interviews mayalso be conducted with the child, depending on his orher age. Along with these interviews, several clinicalinventories may also be used, such as the Conners Rat-ing Scales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Ques-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 411Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 411tionnaire), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and theAchenbach Child Behavior Rating Scales. These inven-tories provide valuable information on the child’s behav-ior in different settings and situations. In addition, theWender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use indiagnosing ADHD in adults.It is important to note that mental disorders such asdepression and anxietydisorder can cause symptomssimilar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psy-chiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHDfrom other possible mood and behavioral disorders.Bipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed, asADHD.Public schools are required by federal law to offerfree ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can alsoprovide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialistfor ADHD assessment. Parents should check with theirinsurance plans to see if these services are covered.
Treatment
Psychosocial therapy, usually combined with med-ications, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviateADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam-phetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) are commonly prescribed to controlhyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase atten-tion span. They work by stimulating the production ofcertain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible sideeffects of stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heart-beat, loss of appetite, and insomnia. However, the med-ications are usually well-tolerated and safe in most cases.In children who don’t respond well to stimulant ther-apy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Nor-pramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are fre-quently recommended. Reported side effects of thesedrugs include persistent dry mouth,sedation, disorien-tation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly withdesipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHDtherapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres-sant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; andcarbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsantdrug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medica-tion, has also been used to control aggression and hyper-activity in some ADHD children, although it should notbe used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medicationwill change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp-toms should be monitored closely and prescriptionsadjusted accordingly.Behavior modification therapy uses a reward systemto reinforce good behavior and task completion and canbe implemented both in the classroom and at home. Atangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the childevery time he completes a task or behaves in an accept-able manner. A chart system may be used to display thestickers and visually illustrate the child’s progress. Whena certain number of stickers are collected, the child maytrade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zooor a day at the beach. The reward system stays in placeuntil the good behavior becomes ingrained.A variation of this technique,cognitive-behavioraltherapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by get-ting the child to recognize the connection betweenthoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by chang-ing negative thinking patterns.Individual psychotherapy can help an ADHD childbuild self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their wor-ries and anxieties, and help them gain insight into theirbehavior and feelings. Family therapymay also be ben-eficial in helping family members develop coping skillsand in working through feelings of guilt or anger parentsmay be experiencing.ADHD children perform better within a familiar,consistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce-ments for good behavior and real consequences for bad.Family, friends, and caretakers should all be educated onthe special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child.Communication between parents and teachers is espe-cially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro-priate learning environment.
Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD.Although there is a lack of controlled studies to provetheir efficacy, proponents report that they are successfulin controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients. Someof the more popular alternative treatments include:

By mea-suring brainwave activity and teaching the ADHDpatient which type of brainwave is associated withattention, EEG biofeedback attempts to train patients togenerate the desired brainwave activity.• Dietary therapy. Based in part on the Feingold foodallergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritionalplan that is high in protein and complex carbohydratesand free of white sugar and salicylate-containing foodssuch as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.• Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of natur-al remedies to address the symptoms of ADHD, suchas ginkgo (Gingko biloba) for memory and mentalsharpness and chamomile (Matricaria recutita) extract for calming. The safety of herbal remedies has notbeen demonstrated in controlled studies. For example,it is known that gingko may affect blood coagulation,but controlled studies have not yet evaluated the risk ofthe effect.• Homeopathic medicine. This is probably the most effec-tive alternative therapy for ADD and ADHD because ittreats the whole person at a core level. Constitutionalhomeopathic care is most appropriate and requires con-sulting with a well-trained homeopath who has experi-ence working with ADD and ADHD individuals.
Prognosis
Untreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s socialand educational performance and can seriously damagehis or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children haveimpaired relationships with their peers, and may belooked upon as social outcasts. They may be perceived asslow learners or troublemakers in the classroom. Siblingsand even parents may develop resentful feelings towardsthe ADHD child.KEY TERMS
Conduct disorder—A behavioral and emotionaldisorder of childhood and adolescence. Childrenwith a conduct disorder act inappropriately,infringe on the rights of others, and violate soci-etal norms.Nervous tic—A repetitive, involuntary action, suchas the twitching of a muscle or repeated blinking.Oppositional defiant disorder—A disorder char-acterized by hostile, deliberately argumentative,and defiant behavior towards authority figures.Some ADHD children also develop a conduct disor-derproblem. For those adolescents who have bothADHD and a conduct disorder, up to 25% go on to devel-op antisocial personality disorder and the criminal behav-ior, substance abuse, and high rate of suicide attempts thatare symptomatic of it. Children diagnosed with ADHDare also more likely to have a learning disorder, a mooddisorder such as depression, or an anxiety disorder.Approximately 70-80% of ADHD patients treatedwith stimulant medication experience significant relieffrom symptoms, at least in the short-term. Approximate-ly half of ADHD children seem to “outgrow” the disor-der in adolescence or early adulthood; the other half willretain some or all symptoms of ADHD as adults. Withearly identification and intervention, careful compliancewith a treatment program, and a supportive and nurturinghome and school environment, ADHD children canflourish socially and academically.Resources

Audiometry
Definition
Audiometry is the testing of a person’s ability tohear various sound frequencies. The test is performedwith the use of electronic equipment called an audiome-ter. This testing is usually administered by a trained tech-nician called an audiologist.
Purpose
Audiometry testing is used to identify and diagnosehearing loss. The equipment is used in health screeningprograms, for example in grade schools, to detect hearingproblems in children. It is also used in the doctor’s office orhospital audiology department to diagnose hearing prob-lems in children, adults, and the elderly. With correct diag-nosis of a person’s specific pattern of hearing impairment,the right type of therapy, which might include hearing aids, corrective surgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.
Precautions
Testing with audiometry equipment is simple andpainless. No special precautions are required.
Description
A trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear-ing loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry test-ing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like musicalnotes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and at differingvolumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done ina soundproof testing room.The person being tested wears a set of headphonesthat blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers atest tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, thepatient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that thesound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume andrepeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it.This process is repeated over a wide range of tones orfrequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowestnote played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping-ing of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is notunusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ fromone ear to the other.A second type of audiometry testing uses a headbandrather than headphones. The headband is worn with smallplastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct soundthrough the bones of the skull. The patient being testedsenses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations throughthe bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, thetones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes.The results of the audiometry test may be recordedon a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph isgenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one endand high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-board. Low notes are graphed on the left and high noteson the right. The graph also charts the volume of thetones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chartto loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured inunits called decibels. Most of the sounds associated withnormal speech patterns are generally spoken in the rangeof 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing candetect tones between 0-20 decibels.Speech audiometry is another type of testing thatuses a series of simple recorded words spoken at variousvolumes into headphones worn by the patient being test-ed. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologistas it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be ableto recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words.

The ears may be examined with an otoscope prior toaudiometry testing to determine if there are any block-ages in the ear canal due to ear wax or other material.
Normal results
A person with normal hearing will be able to recog-nize and respond to all of the tone frequencies adminis-tered at various volumes in both ears by the audiometrytest. An adult with normal hearing can detect a range oflow and high pitched sounds that are played as softly asbetween nearly 0-20 decibels. Normal speech is general-ly spoken in the range of 20-50 decibels.
Abnormal results
Audiometry test results are considered abnormal ifthere is a significant or unexplained difference betweenthe levels of sound heard between the two ears, or if theperson being tested is unable to hear in the normal rangeof frequencies and volume. The pattern of responses dis-played on the audiogram can be used by the audiologistto identify if a significant hearing loss is present and ifthe patient might benefit from hearing aids or correctivesurgery.Resources

Auditory integration training
Definition
Auditory integration training, or AIT, is one specifictype of music/auditory therapy based upon the work ofFrench otolaryngologists Dr. Alfred Tomatis and Dr. GuyBerard.
Origins
The premise upon which most auditory integrationprograms are based is that distortion in how things areheard contributes to commonly seen behavioral or learningdisorders in children. Some of these disorders includeattention deficit/hyperactive disorder(ADHD),autism, dyslexia, and central auditory processing disorders(CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate cen-tral and cortical organization.Auditory integration is one facet of what audiolo-gists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin-ition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi-ty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, whichis: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditoryintegration is actually the perception of sound, includingthe ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining itin both the long- and short-term memory, to be able tolisten to sound selectively, and to localize it.Guy Berard developed one of the programs com-monly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con-sists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi-cal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran-dom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listensthrough earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer-cise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done insessions twice a day for 10 days.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 415Auditory integration trainingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 415Alfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the ElectronicEar. This device operates through a series of filters, andreestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing. Thebasis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow:• The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt soundwaves into signals that charge the brain.• Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can beconsidered something that nourishes the nervous sys-tem, either stimulating or destimulating it.• Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is notthe same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening isactive.• A person’s ability to listen affects all language develop-ment for that person. This process influences everyaspect of self-image and social development.• The capacity to listen can be changed or improvedthrough auditory stimulation using musical and vocalsounds at high frequencies.ALFRED TOMATIS (1920– )
• Communication begins in the womb. As early as thebeginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hearsounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner-vous system of the baby to develop.
Description
A quartet of CAP defects have been identified thatcan unfavorably alter how each person processes sound.Among these are:• Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when thebrain incorrectly decodes what is being heard. Soundsare unrecognizable, often because the person speakingtalks too fast.• Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little orpoor tolerance for background sounds.• Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to puttogether things heard with things seen. Characteristical-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 416Auditory integration training
Internationally renowned French otolaryngologist,psychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per-ceived the importance of sound and hearing early in hiscareer. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine fromthe University of Paris and specialized in ear, nose andthroat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatisearly in his career treated some of his parents’ fellowopera singers. From these experiences with the sound ofmusic, he developed the principle that has come to beknown as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice canonly sing what it hears.Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It washis research that made the world aware that the ears of aninfant in utero are already functioning at four and halfmonths of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour-ishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulatedthat the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrientheard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu-lates the growth of the brain.Tomatis took this further, into the realm of language.Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and tobe understood are among our most basic needs. He was apioneer in perceiving that language problems convert intosocial problems for people. “Language is what character-izes man and makes him different from other creatures,”Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developedto teach people how to listen effectively are international-ly respected tools used in the treatment of autism, atten-tion-deficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.His listening program, the invention of the ElectronicEar, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound andmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguablythe best known and most successful ear specialist in theworld. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centersworldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related tothe ability to hear.

It is characterizedby disorganization in handling auditory and other infor-mation.Certain audiological tests are carried out to see if theperson has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is.Other tests give more specific information regarding thenature of the CAP problem. They include:• Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea-sures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, thenbone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibrationof small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.• Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per-son’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done bypresenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the per-son’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scoresequal the percentage of words heard correctly.• Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessingthe status of, and the protective mechanisms of the mid-dle ear.• Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40compound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibelsabove threshold to each ear of the person being tested.This test provides expanded information that makes itpossible to break down CAP problems into the fourbasic types.• Speech in noise discrimination (SN) testing is similar toStaggered Sporadic Word testing except that other noiseis also added and the percentage correct in quiet is com-pared with that correct when there is added noise.• Phonemic synthesis (PS) determines serious learningproblems. The types of errors made in sounding outwritten words or associating written letters with thesounds they represent help in determining the type andseverity of CAP problems.
Purpose
Upon completion of an auditory integration trainingprogram, the person’s hearing should be capable of per-ceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same level. Totalimprovement from this therapy, in both hearing andbehavior, can take up to one year.
Research and general acceptance
Auditory integration training is based upon newlylearned information about the brain. Though brain struc-tures and connections are predetermined, probably byheredity, another factor called plasticityalso comes intoplay. Learning, we now know, continues from birth todeath. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actuallychange its structuring and connections through theprocess of learning.Problems with auditory processing are now viewedas having a wide–reaching ripple effect on our society. Itis estimated that 30–40% of children starting school havelanguage-learning skills that can be described as poor.CAP difficulties are a factor in several different learningdisabilities. They affect not only academic success, butalso nearly every aspect of societal difficulties. Oneexample to illustrate this is a 1989 University of Buffalostudy where CAP problems were found to be present in asurprising 97% of youth inmates in an upstate New Yorkcorrections facility.ResourcesBOOKS

Autism
Definition
Autism is a severe disorder of brain function markedby problems with social contact, intelligence and lan-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 417Auditory integration trainingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 417guage, together with ritualistic or compulsive behaviorand bizarre responses to the environment.
Description
Autism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with theability to understand what is seen, heard, and touched.This can cause profound problems in personal behaviorand in the ability to relate to others. A person withautism must learn how to communicate normally andhow to relate to people, objects and events. However,not all patients suffer the same degree of impairment.There is a full spectrum of symptoms, which can rangefrom mild to severe.Autism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000children. It is found four times more often in boys (usual-ly the first-born) and occurs around the world in all racesand social backgrounds. Autism usually is evident in thefirst three years of life, although in some children it’shard to tell when the problem develops. Sometimes thecondition isn’t diagnosed until the child enters school.While a person with autism can have symptomsranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an extraor-dinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, mem-ory, music, or art. Such children are known as “autisticsavants” (formerly known as “idiot savants.”).
Causes and symptoms
Autism is a brain disorder that affects the way thebrain uses or transmits information. Studies have foundabnormalities in several parts of the brain that almostcertainly occurred during fetal development. The prob-lem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsiblefor processing language and information from the senses.There appears to be a strong genetic basis forautism. Identical twins are more likely to both beaffected than twins who are fraternal (not geneticallyidentical). In a family with one autistic child, thechance of having another child with autism is about 1in 20, much higher than in the normal population.Sometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mildbehaviors that look very much like autism, such asrepetitive behaviors and social or communication prob-lems. Research also has found that some emotional dis-orders (such as manic depression) occur more often infamilies of a child with autism.At least one group of researchers has found a linkbetween an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may bejust one of at least three to five genes that interact insome way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect that afaulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable todevelop autism in the presence of other factors, such as achemical imbalance, viruses or chemicals, or a lack ofoxygen at birth.In a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a dis-ease such as:•rubellain the pregnant mother• tuberous sclerosis•fragile X syndrome• encephalitis• untreated phenylketonuria.The severity of the condition varies between individ-uals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual,repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive behavior) tovery mild, resembling a personality disorder with somelearning disability.Profound problems with social interaction are themost common symptoms of autism. Infants with the dis-order won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and don’tseem to want or need physical contact or affection. Theymay become rigid or flaccid when they are held, cry whenpicked up, and show little interest in human contact. Sucha child doesn’t smile or lift his arms in anticipation ofbeing picked up. He forms no attachment to parents norshows any normal anxietytoward strangers. He doesn’tlearn typical games of childhood, such as peek-a-boo.Language problemsThe child with autism may not speak at all; if hedoes, it is often in single words. He may endlessly repeatwords or phrases that are addressed to him and mayreverse pronouns (“You go sleep” instead of “I want togo to sleep”).Restricted interests and activityUsually a child with autism has many problemsplaying normally. He probably won’t act out adultrolesduring play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play, hemay simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someoneelse. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common amongautistic children and may include complex rituals,screaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, fingertwiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic childrenmay play with their own saliva, feces or urine.They maybe self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging attheir eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head.Sensory problemsThe sensory world poses a real problem to manyautistic children, who seem overwhelmed by their ownsenses. A child with autism may ignore objects or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 418AutismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 418become obsessed with them, continually watching theobject or the movement of his fingers over it. Many ofthese children may react to sounds by banging their heador flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic adultswho have written books about their childhood experi-ences report that sounds were often excruciatinglypainful to them, forcing them to withdraw from theirenvironment or try to cope by withdrawing into their ownworld of sensation and movement.Intellectual problemsMost autistic children appear to be moderately mental-ly retarded. They may giggle or cry for no reason, have nofear of real danger, but exhibit terror of harmless objects.
Diagnosis
There is no medical test for autism. Because thesymptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may goundiagnosed for some time (especially in those with mildcases or if other handicaps are also present). It may beconfused with other diseases, such as fragile X syndrome,tuberous sclerosis, and untreated phenylketonuria.Autism is diagnosed by observing the child’s behav-ior, communication skills, and social interactions. Med-ical tests should rule out other possible causes of autisticsymptoms. Criteria that mental health experts use todiagnose autism include:• problems with developing friendships• problems with make-believe or social play• endlessly repeated words or strings of words• difficulty in carrying on a conversation• obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns• preoccupation with parts of objectsSome children have a few of the symptoms of autism,but not enough to be diagnosed with the “classical” formof the condition. Children who have autistic behavior butno problems with language may be diagnosed with“Asperger syndrome.” Children who seem normal at firstbut who begin to show autistic behavior as they get oldermight be diagnosed with “childhood disintegrative disor-der” (CDD). These problems are sometimes called “autis-tic spectrum disorders.” It is also important to rule outother problems that seem similar to autism.

There is no cure for autism. Treatments are aimed atreducing specific symptoms. Because the symptoms varyso widely from one person to the next, there is not a sin-gle approach that works for every person. A spectrum ofinterventions include training in music, listening, vision,speech and language, and senses. Special dietsand med- ications may also be prescribed.Studies show that people with autism can improvesignificantly with proper treatment. A child with autismcan learn best with special teachers in a structured pro-gram that emphasizes individual instruction. The twomost-often studied types of treatment are:Educational or behavioral treatmentTypically, behavioral techniques are used to help thechild respond and decrease symptoms. This mightinclude positive reinforcement (food and rewards) toboost language and social skills. This training includesstructured, skill-oriented instruction designed to boostsocial and language abilities. Training needs to begin asearly as possible, since early intervention appears toinfluence brain development.Most experts believe that modern treatment is mosteffective when carried out at home, although treatmentKEY TERMS

Drugs also can controlepilepsy, which afflicts up to 20% of people with autism.Five types of drugs are sometimes prescribed to helpthe behavior problems of people with autism:• stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin)• antidepressants, such as fluroxamine (Luvox)• opiate blockers, such as naltrexone (ReVia)• antipsychotics• tranquilizersToday, most experts recommend a complex treat-ment regimen that begins early and continues through theteenage years.

Someresearchers claim that it improves speech in children withautism. Those who respond to this treatment will usuallydo so within a week. Again, many doctors do not feel thatthe studies are adequate to promote this treatment.ExerciseOne researcher found that vigorous exercise(20 minutes or longer, three or four days a week) seems todecrease hyperactivity, aggression, self-injury and otherautistic symptoms.
Prognosis
While there is no cure, with appropriate treatmentthe negative behaviors of autism may improve. Earliergenerations placed autistic children in institutions; today,even severely disabled children can be helped in a lessrestrictive environment to develop to their highest poten-tial. Many can eventually become more responsive toothers as they learn to understand the world around them,and some can lead nearly normal lives.People with autism have a normal life expectancy.Some people with autism can handle a job; they do bestwith structured jobs that involve a degree of repetition.

Until the cause of autism is discovered, prevention isnot possible.Resources

Definition
Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which aperson’s immune system attacks the body’s own cells,causing tissue destruction.
Description
Autoimmunity is accepted as the cause of a widerange of disorders, and it is suspected to be responsible formany more. Autoimmune diseases are classified as eithergeneral, in which the autoimmune reaction takes placesimultaneously in a number of tissues, or organ specific, inwhich the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ.Autoimmune disorders include the following:•Systemic lupus erythematosus. A general autoim-mune disease in which antibodies attack a number ofdifferent tissues. The disease recurs periodically and isseen mainly in young and middle-aged women.•Rheumatoid arthritis. Occurs when the immune sys-tem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone jointsand cartilage. The disease occurs throughout the body,although some joints may be more affected than others.• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies aredeposited in the membranes of both the lung and kid-neys, causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulus(glomerulonephritis) and lung bleeding. It is typicallya disease of young males.• Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds tospecific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them tomake excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Caused by an antibody thatbinds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’sdisease, however, this antibody’s action results in lessthyroid hormone being made.• Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disordersthat affect the skin.•Myasthenia gravis. A condition in which the immunesystem attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cells,preventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulsesand resulting in severe muscle weakness.•Scleroderma. Also called CREST syndrome or pro-gressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma affects theconnective tissue.• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Occurs when thebody produces antibodies that coat red blood cells.• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Disorder inwhich the immune system targets and destroys bloodplatelets.•Polymyositisand Dermatomyositis. Immune disordersthat affect the neuromuscular system.•Pernicious anemia. Disorder in which the immunesystem attacks the lining of the stomach in such a waythat the body cannot metabolize vitamin B
12.• Sjögren’s syndrome. Occurs when the exocrine glandsare attacked by the immune system, resulting in exces-sive dryness.•Ankylosing spondylitis. Immune system induceddegeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine.•Vasculitis. A group of autoimmune disorders in whichthe immune system attacks and destroys blood vessels.• Type I diabetes mellitus. May be caused by an anti-body that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the pan-creas, which produce insulin.• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. Also called LouGehrig’s disease. An immune disorder that causes thedeathof neurons which leads to progressive loss ofmuscular control.• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also called infectiouspolyneuritis. Often occurring after an infection or animmunization (specifically Swine flu), the diseaseaffects the myelin sheath, which coats nerve cells. Itcauses progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. •Multiple sclerosis. An autoimmune disorder that mayinvolve a virus affects the central nervous system, caus-ing loss of coordination and muscle control.
Causes and symptoms
To further understand autoimmune disorders, it ishelpful to understand the workings of the immune sys-tem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend thebody against attack by infectious microbes (germs) andforeign objects. When the immune system attacks aninvader, it is very specific—a particular immune systemcell will only recognize and target one type of invader.To function properly, the immune system must not onlydevelop this specialized knowledge of individualinvaders, but it must also learn how to recognize andnot destroy cells that belong to the body itself. Everycell carries protein markers on its surface that identifiesit in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is (e.g. nervecell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to whom that cellbelongs. These markers are called major histocompata-bility complexes (MHCs). When functioning properly,cells of the immune system will not attack any othercell with markers identifying it as belonging to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 422Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 422body. Conversely, if the immune system cells do notrecognize the cell as “self,” they attach themselves to itand put out a signal that the body has been invaded,which in turn stimulates the production of substancessuch as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreignparticles. In case of autoimmune disorders, the immunesystem cannot distinguish between “self” cells andinvader cells. As a result, the same destructive operationis carried out on the body’s own cells that would nor-mally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and other suchharmful entities.The reasons why immune systems become dys-functional in this way is not well understood. However,most researchers agree that a combination of genetic,environmental, and hormonal factors play into autoim-munity. Researchers also speculate that certain mecha-nisms may trigger autoimmunity. First, a substance thatis normally restricted to one part of the body, and there-fore not usually exposed to the immune system, isreleased into other areas where it is attacked. Second,the immune system may mistake a component of thebody for a similar foreign component. Third, cells ofthe body may be altered in some way, either by drugs,infection, or some other environmental factor, so thatthey are no longer recognizable as “self” to the immunesystem. Fourth, the immune system itself may be dam-aged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore can-not function properly.
Symptoms
The symptoms of the above disorders include:• Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms includefever, chills,fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes(particu-larly the classic “butterfly” rash on the face), vasculitis,polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth ornose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems, and,in women, irregular periods. About half of those whosuffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems,and some may also develop urinary problems. Lupuscan also effect the central nervous system, causingseizures, depression, and psychosis.• Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized by alow-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and a gener-alized painin the joints. The joint pain then becomesmore specific, usually beginning in the fingers, thenspreading to other areas, such as the wrists, elbows,knees, and ankles. As the disease progresses, joint func-tion diminishes sharply and deformities occur, particular-ly the characteristic “swan’s neck” curling of the fingers.• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to thatof iron deficiency anemia, including fatigue and pal-lor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range from acoughthat produces bloody sputum to outright hemor-rhaging. Symptoms involving the urinary systeminclude blood in the urine and/or swelling.• Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by anenlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss ofappetite, sweating, heart palpitations, nervousness,and an inability to tolerate heat.• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis-plays no symptoms.• Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized byblisters and deep lesions on the skin.• Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus-cle weakness that at first may be confined to certainmuscle groups, but then may progress to the point ofparalysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have expres-sionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swal-lowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory sys-tem, artificial respiration may be required.• Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by Ray-naud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow includepain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and the skintakes on a tight, shiny appearance. The digestive systemalso becomes involved, resulting in weight loss, appetiteloss,diarrhea,constipation, and distention of theabdomen. As the disease progresses, the heart, lungs,and kidneys become involved, and malignant hyperten-sioncauses death in approximately 30% of cases.• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute orchronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal ten-derness due to an enlarged spleen.• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterizedby pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplainedbruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood inthe stool.• Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,symptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in theshoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from per-forming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis, thesame muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash thatappears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips. A rashmay also appear on the eyelids, and the area around theeyes may become swollen.• Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemiainclude weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, andtingling in the extremities. Because the disease caus-es a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, lossof appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipationare possible. Also, because Vitamin B
12is essentialfor the nervous system function, the deficiency of itbrought on by the disease can result in a host of neu-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 423Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 423rological problems, including weakness, lack of coor-dination, blurred vision, loss of fine motor skills, lossof the sense of taste, ringing in the ears, and loss ofbladder control.• Sjögren’s syndrome. Characterized by excessive dry-ness of the mouth and eyes.• Ankylosing spondylitis. Generally begins with lowerback pain that progresses up the spine. The pain mayeventually become crippling.• Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of veinsaffected and can range greatly.• Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue andan abnormally high level of glucose in the blood(hyperglycemia).• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum-bling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, musclecramps and twitching may be observed as well asweakness in the hands making fastening buttons orturning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed orslurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. Asrespiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased dangerof aspiration or lung infection.• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legsoccurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (aprickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorderaffects both sides of the body and may involve paralysisand the muscles that control breathing.• Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the firstsymptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or exhaustionis often reported, as well as blurry or double vision.There may be dizziness, depression, loss of bladdercontrol, and muscle weakness so severe that the patientis confined to a wheelchair.
Diagnosis
A number of tests are involved in the diagnosis ofautoimmune diseases, depending on the particular dis-ease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, elec-tromylogram (measures muscle function), and magnetic resonance imagingof the brain. Usually, these testsdetermine the location and extent of damage or involve-ment. They are useful in charting progress of the diseaseand as baselines for treatment.The principle tool, however, for authenticatingautoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such testsinvolve measuring the level of antibodies found in theblood and determining if they react with specific anti-gens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. Anelevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoralimmune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibodylevels are also seen in common infections, they must beruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels.Antibodies can also be typed by class. There are fiveclasses of antibodies, and they can be separated in thelaboratory. The class IgG is usually associated withautoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class antibod-ies are also the main class of antibody seen in normalimmune responses.The most useful antibody tests involve introducingthe patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her own tis-sue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney tissue. Ifantibodies bind to the “self” tissue, it is diagnostic for anautoimmune disorder. Antibodies from a person withoutan autoimmune disorder would not react to “self” tissue.Treatment
Treatment of autoimmune diseases is specific tothe disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating orpreventing symptoms rather than correcting the under-lying cause. For example, if a gland involved in anautoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone suchas insulin, administration of that hormone is required.Administration of a hormone, however, will restorethe function of the gland damaged by the autoimmunedisease.The other aspect of treatment is controlling theinflammatory and proliferative nature of the immuneresponse. This is generally accomplished with two typesof drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control inflam-mation. There are many different steroids, each havingside effects. The proliferative nature of the immuneresponse is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs.These drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cellsand, therefore, also suppress non-immune cells leadingto side effects such as anemia.Systemic enzyme therapyis a new treatment that isshowing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero-sis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory dis-eases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin, trypsin,chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help stimulate thebody’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order toreduce swelling and improve circulation, and break upthe immune complexes within the bloodstream. Symp-toms have been reduced using this treatment.Other treatments that hold some promise are irradia-tion of the spleen and gene therapy. Splenic irradiationis touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with autoim-mune blood diseases, especially autoimmune hemolyticanemia, or others with compromised immune systems,such as HIV patients and the elderly. It is reported tohave few side effects and seems to be working. Cytokine
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 424Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 424and cytokine inhibitor genes injected directly into muscletissue also appear to be effective in treating Type I dia-betes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroditis,and arthritis.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends upon the pathology of eachautoimmune disease.
Prevention
Most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented.Though the mechanisms involved in how these diseasesaffect the body are known, it is still unclear why the bodyturns on itself. Since more women than men seem to beaffected by some of these disorders (e.g. lupus), someresearchers are looking into hormones as a factor. This,and gene therapy, may be the preventatives of the future.Resources

Autopsy
Definition
An autopsy is a postmortem assessment or examina-tion of a body to determine the cause of death. An autop-sy is performed by a physician trained in pathology.
Purpose
Most autopsies advance medical knowledge andprovide evidence for legal action. Medically, autopsiesdetermine the exact cause and circumstances of death,discover the pathway of a disease, and provide valuableinformation to be used in the care of the living. Whenfoul play is suspected, a government coroner or medicalexaminer performs autopsies for legal use. This branchof medical study is called forensic medicine. Forensicspecialists investigate deaths resulting from violence oroccurring under suspicious circumstances.Benefits of research from autopsies include the pro-duction of new medical information on diseases such astoxic shock syndrome, acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome (AIDS). Organ donation, which can potential-ly save the lives of other patients, is also another benefitof autopsies.
Precautions
When performed for medical reasons, autopsiesrequire formal permission from family members or thelegal guardian. (Autopsies required for legal reasonswhen foul play is suspected do not need the consent ofnext of kin.) During the autopsy, very concise notes anddocumentation must be made for both medical and legalreasons. Some religious groups prohibit autopsies.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 425AutopsyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 425Description
An autopsy can be described as the examination of adeceased human body with a detailed exam of the per-son’s remains. This procedure dates back to the Romanera when few human dissections were performed; autop-sies were utilized, however, to determine the cause ofdeath in criminal cases. At the beginning of the proce-dure the exterior body is examined and then the internalorgans are removed and studied. Some pathologistsargue that more autopsies are performed than necessary.However, recent studies show that autopsies can detectmajor findings about a person’s condition that were notsuspected when the person was alive. And the growingawareness of the influence of genetic factors in diseasehas also emphasized the importance of autopsies.Despite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autopsieshave been performed in the United States during the pastKEY TERMS
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)—A group of diseases resulting from infection withthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A per-son infected with HIV gradually loses immunefunction, becoming less able to resist aliments andcancers, resulting in eventual death.Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—The tech-nique used in diagnostic studies of internal bodilystructures in the detection of tumors or brainaneurysms. This diagnostic test consists of a com-puter analysis of a series of cross-sectional scansmade along a single axis of a bodily structure ortissue that is used to construct a three-dimensionalimage of that structureCreutzfeld-Jakob disease—A rare, often fatal dis-ease of the brain, characterized by gradual demen-tia and loss of muscle control that occurs mostoften in middle age and is caused by a slow virus.Hepatitis—Inflammation of the liver, caused byinfectious or toxic agents and characterized byjaundice, fever, liver enlargement, and abdominalpain.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—A diagnostictool that utilizes nuclear magnetic energy in theproduction of images of specific atoms and molec-ular structures in solids, especially human cells,tissues, and organs.Postmortem—After death.10-20 years. A possible reason for this decline is concernabout malpractice suits on the part of the treating physi-cian. Other possible reasons are that hospitals are per-forming fewer autopsies because of the expense orbecause modern technology, such as CT scans and mag- netic resonance imaging, can often provide sufficientdiagnostic information. Nonetheless, federal regulatorsand pathology groups have begun to establish new guide-lines designed to increase the number and quality ofautopsies being performed.Many experts are concerned that if the number ofautopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to chargefamilies a fee for the procedure as autopies are not nor-mally covered by insurance companies or Medicare. Yet,according to several pathologists, the benefit of the pro-cedure for families and doctors does justify the cost. Inmedical autopsies, physicians remain cautious to exam-ine only as much of the body as permitted according tothe wishes of the family. It is important to note thatautopsies can also provide peace of mind for thebereaved family in certain situations.
Preparation
If a medical autopsy is being performed, written per-mission is secured from the family of the deceased
Aftercare
Once the autopsy has been completed, the body isprepared for final arrangements according to the family’swishes
Risks
There are some risks of disease transmission fromthe deceased. In fact, some physicans may refuse to doautopsies on specific patients because of a fear of con-tracting diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, or Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.
Normal results
In most situations the cause of death is determinedfrom the procedure of an autopsy without any transmis-sion of disease.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results would include inconclusive resultsfrom the autopsy and transmission of infectious diseaseduring the autopsy.

Aviation medicine
Definition
Also known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine,or space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical spe-cialty that focuses on the physical and psychologicalconditions associated with flying and space travel.
Purpose
Since flying airplanes and spacecraft involves greatrisk and physical demands, such as changes in gravityand oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical expertsto protect their safety and the public’s safety.
Description
Pressure changesIn the United States, the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly above 14,500 ft(4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure changes caused bylower oxygen levels at high altitude. Pilots must eitherhave a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen mask.Without these protections, they could experience hypox-ia, or altitude sickness. Hypoxia reduces the amount ofoxygen in the brain, causing such symptoms asdizziness,shortness of breath, and mental confusion.These symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control ofthe plane. Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy.Rapid altitude increases and decreases can causepainbecause there is an air pocket in the middle portionof the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typ-ically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinusesby plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrums“pop.” Other options include yawning, swallowing orchewing gum. For people with a cold or a severelyblocked middle ear, the use of decongestants,antihista-mines, or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps toequalize pressure, the tympanic membrane could rupture,causing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness, and nausea.Gravity’s impactFighter pilots who fly high-performance jets canexperience health problems during rapid acceleration andwhen executing tight turns at high speed. During thesemoves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditionsthat can pull blood away from the brain and heart andinto the lower body. This can cause the pilot to have tun-nel vision or pass out. To prevent these potentially deadlysituations, the military requires fighter pilots to wear spe-cial flight suits, or G suits, which have compartmentsthat fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling inthe lower body.Some pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a techniquecalled the Valsalva Maneuverinstead of G suits to pre-vent black outs during high-performance flying. The Val-salva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening theabdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in thewrong parts of the body.
PREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health problemthat affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds oflives, aviation medicine specialists who work for com-mercial airlines and the military take special care to edu-cate pilots about proper diet,exerciseand preventivehealth tools. For example, physicians may frequentlyscreen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucomaor cataracts. They also will check for hearing loss andencourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones tobuffer engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi-cians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostictests such as an ECG or stress test.Motion sicknessMany people experience nausea, vertigo, and disori-entation when they first arrive in space. This is caused bychanges in the fluid in the inner ear, which is sensitive togravity and affects our sense of spatial orientation. Thesymptoms typically ease after several days, but oftenrecur when the astronaut returns to Earth. To treat thiscondition, physicians give astronauts motion sicknessmedication, such as lorazepam.Bone and muscle lossIn zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone andmuscle mass. On earth, the natural resistance of gravityhelps build stronger muscles and bones during normal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 427Aviation medicineGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 427weight-bearing activities like walking or even sitting at adesk. In space, however, astronauts must work harder toprevent bone and muscle loss. Exercise is an importanttreatment. Crew members may use an exercise cycle orresistive rubber bands to stay in shape. Physicians also maygive them medication to prevent bone loss and prescribenutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essentialamino acids and carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy.RadiationAnother health threat to space travelers is radiation.Harmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells andcause cancer. Excess radiation also can weaken theimmune system. To prevent these problems, physiciansmay give astronauts nutritional supplements. For exam-ple, research has show that n-3 fatty acids found in fishoil reduce DNA damage.Cardiovascular issuesWhen astronauts return to earth after a long mission,they tend to feel dizzy and black out. Scientists are con-cerned about this dilemma because it could be dangerousif the crew members need to make an emergency exit.One way to prevent this problem, which is caused by adrop in blood pressure, is to have the astronauts drinkextra fluids and increase salt intake to increase blood vol-ume. Physicians also may prescribe medication thatcauses blood vessels to contract. As another precaution,astronauts also put on protective flight suits, or G suits,before they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere.KEY TERMS

Ayurvedic medicine
Definition
Ayurvedic medicine is a system of healing thatoriginated in ancient India. In Sanskrit,ayurmeans life or living, and vedameans knowledge, so Ayurvedahas been defined as the “knowledge of living” or the“science of longevity.” Ayurvedic medicine utilizesdiet,detoxificationand purification techniques,herbal and mineral remedies,yoga, breathing exercis-es,meditation, and massage therapyas holistic heal-ing methods. Ayurvedic medicine is widely practicedin modern India and has been steadily gaining follow-ers in the West.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 428Aviation medicineGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 428Purpose
According to the original texts, the goal of Ayurvedais prevention as well as promotion of the body’s owncapacity for maintenance and balance. Ayurvedic treat-ment is non-invasive and non-toxic, so it can be usedsafely as an alternative therapy or alongside conventionaltherapies. Ayurvedic physicians claim that their methodscan also help stress-related, metabolic, and chronic con-ditions. Ayurveda has been used to treat acne,allergies, asthma,anxiety, arthritis,chronic fatigue syndrome, colds, colitis,constipation, depression, diabetes, flu,heart disease,hypertension, immune problems, inflam-mation,insomnia, nervous disorders,obesity, skin prob-lems, and ulcers.Ayurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots of adisease before it gets so advanced that more radical treat-ments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda seems to be limitedin treating severely advanced conditions, traumaticinjuries, acute pain, and conditions and injuries requiringinvasive surgery. Ayurvedic techniques have also beenused alongside chemotherapyand surgery to assistpatients in recovery and healing.
Description
OriginsAyurvedic medicine originated in the early civiliza-tions of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is men-tioned in the Vedas, the ancient religious and philosophi-cal texts that are the oldest surviving literature in theworld, which makes Ayurvedic medicine the oldest sur-viving healing system. According to the texts, Ayurvedawas conceived by enlightened wise men as a system ofliving harmoniously and maintaining the body so thatmental and spiritual awareness could be possible. Med-ical historians believe that Ayurvedic ideas were trans-ported from ancient India to China and were instrumentalin the development of Chinese medicine.

DEEPAK CHOPRA (1946– )
Deepak Chopra was born in India and studied medi-cine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. He lefthis home for the United States in 1970 and completedresidencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. Hewent on to teaching posts at major medical institutions—Tufts University and Boston University schools of medi-cine—while establishing a very successful private prac-tice. By the time he was thirty-five, Chopra had becomechief of staff at New England Memorial Hospital.Disturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on med-ication, he began a search for alternatives and discoveredone in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, anIndian spiritualist who had gained a cult following in thelate sixties teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM).Chopra began practicing TM fervently and eventually metthe Maharishi. In 1985 Chopra established the AyurvedicHealth Center for Stress Management and BehavioralMedicine in Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he beganhis practice of integrating the best aspects of Eastern andWestern medicine.In 1993, he published Creating Affluence: WealthConsciousness in the Field of All Possibilities , and the enormously successful best seller, Ageless Body, TimelessMind. In the latter he presents his most radical thesis: thataging is not the inevitable deterioration of organs andmind that we have been traditionally taught to think of itas. It is a process that can be influenced, slowed down,and even reversed with the correct kinds of therapies,almost all of which are self-administered or self-taught.He teaches that applying a regimen of nutritional bal-ance, meditation, and emotional clarity characterized bysuch factors as learning to easily and quickly expressanger, for instance, can lead to increased lifespans of upto 120 years.
(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 429Today, Ayurvedic medicine is used by 80% of thepopulation in India. Aided by the efforts of DeepakChopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasinglyaccepted alternative medical treatment in America duringthe last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has writtenseveral bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He alsohelped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine inLa Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that trainsphysicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces herbalremedies, and conducts research and documentation ofits healing techniques.Key ideasTo understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary tohave an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body.The basic life force in the body is prana, which is alsofound in the elements and is similar to the Chinesenotion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi andexpert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light-rays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media throughwhich the prana is carried.”In Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that con-tain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These ele-ments interact and are further organized in the humanbody as three main categories or basic physiologicalprinciples in the body that govern all bodily functionsknown as the doshas. The three doshas are vata, pitta,and kapha. Each person has a unique blend of the threedoshas, known as the person’s prakriti, which is whyAyurvedic treatment is always individualized. InAyurveda, disease is viewed as a state of imbalance inone or more of a person’s doshas, and an Ayurvedicphysician strives to adjust and balance them, using avariety of techniques.The vata dosha is associated with air and ether, andin the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo-ple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned,and very energetic and mentally restless. When vata isout of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper-activity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches.Pitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, itis responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta char-acteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strongdigestion, and good mental concentration. Pitta imbal-ances show up as anger and aggression and stress-relat-ed conditions like gastritis, ulcers, liver problems, andhypertension.The kapha dosha is associated with water and earth.People characterized as kapha are generally large orheavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow,calm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional-ly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity,fatigue,bronchitis, and sinus problems.DiagnosisIn Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as animbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic processstrives to determine which doshas are underactive oroveractive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over acourse of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician tomost accurately determine what parts of the body arebeing affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physi-cians often use long questionnaires and interviews todetermine a person’s dosha patterns and physical andpsychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intri-cately observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fin-gernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believecan indicate deeper problems in the internal systems.Some Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests toassist in diagnosis.

Usually the firstmethod of treatment involves some sort of detoxificationand cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulatedtoxins must be removed before any other methods oftreatment will be effective. Methods of detoxificationinclude therapeutic vomiting,laxatives, medicated ene- mas,fasting, and cleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayur-vedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods intointensive sessions known as panchakarma. Panchakarmacan take several days or even weeks and they are morethan elimination therapies. They also include herbalizedoil massage and herbalized heat treatments. After purifi-cation, Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineralremedies to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicinecontains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specifichealth problems.Ayurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people livetheir lives from day to day, believing that proper lifestylesand routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and preven-tion. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exerciseto build strength and health, and also advises massage thera-py and self-massage as ways of increasing circulation andreducing stress. Yogic breathing techniques and medita-tion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, toreduce stress and improve mental energy.Of all treatments, though, diet is one of the mostbasic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system.An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and indi-vidualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are sixbasic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astrin-gent. Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggra-vate a particular dosha. For instance, sweet, sour, andsalty decrease vata problems and increase kapha. Sour,salty, and pungent can increase pitta. After an Ayurvedicphysician determines a person’s dosha profile, they willrecommend a specific diet to correct imbalances andincrease health. The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarilyvegetarian foods of high quality and freshness, tailored tothe season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten inthe summer and heating ones in the winter, always withina person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine, the heav-iest meal of the day should be lunch, and dinner shouldeaten well before bedtime, to allow for complete diges-tion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with properchewing and state of mind is important, as is combiningfoods properly and avoiding overeating.CostCosts of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with initialconsultations running anywhere from $40 to over $100,KEY TERMS

Preparations
Ayurveda is a mind/body system of health that con-tains some ideas foreign to the Western scientificmodel. Those people considering Ayurveda shouldapproach it with an open mind and willingness toexperiment. Also, because Ayurveda is a whole-bodysystem of healing and health, patience and disciplineare helpful, as some conditions and diseases arebelieved to be brought on by years of bad health habitsand require time and effort to correct. Finally, theAyurvedic philosophy believes that each person has theability to heal themselves, so those considering Ayurve-da should be prepared to bring responsibility and partic-ipation into the treatment.
Precautions
An Ayurvedic practitioner should always be consulted.
Side effects
During Ayurvedic detoxification programs, somepeople report fatigue, muscle soreness, and general sick-ness. Also, as Ayurveda seeks to release mental stressesand psychological problems from the patient, some peo-ple can experience mental disturbances and depressionduring treatment, and psychological counseling may bepart of a sound program.

Because Ayurveda had been outside the Western sci-entific system for years, research in the United States isnew. Another difficulty in documentation arises becauseAyurvedic treatment is very individualized; two peoplewith the same disease but different dosha patterns mightbe treated differently. Much more scientific research hasbeen conducted over the past several decades in India.Much research in the United States is being supported bythe Maharishi Ayur-Ved organization, which studies theAyurvedic products it sells and its clinical practices.Some Ayurvedic herbal mixtures have been proven tohave high antioxidant properties, much stronger than vita- minsA, C, and E, and some have also been shown in labo-ratory tests to reduce or eliminate tumors in mice and toinhibit cancergrowth in human lung tumor cells. In a1987 study at MIT, an Ayurvedic herbal remedy wasshown to significantly reduce colon cancerin rats. Anoth-er study was performed in the Netherlands with MaharishiAyur-Ved products. A group of patients with chronic ill-nesses, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, hyperten-sion, eczema,psoriasis, constipation,rheumatoid arthri-tis, headaches, and non-insulin dependent diabetes melli-tus, were given Ayurvedic treatment. Strong results wereobserved, with nearly 80% of the patients improving andsome chronic conditions being completely cured.Other studies have shown that Ayurvedic therapiescan significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure instress-related problems. Diabetes, acne, and allergieshave also been successfully treated with Ayurvedic reme-dies. Ayurvedic products have been shown to increaseshort-term memory and reduce headaches. Also,Ayurvedic remedies have been used successfully to sup-port the healing process of patients undergoingchemotherapy, as these remedies have been demonstratedto increase immune system activity.Resources

Babesiosis
Definition
Babesiosis is an infection of red blood cells causedby the single-celled parasite,Babesia microti, which is spread to humans by a tick bite.
Description
Babesiosis is a rare, tick-transmitted disease that iscaused most often by the single-celled parasite Babesia microti. By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of babesiosis hadbeen reported in the United States. The disease occursprimarily in New England and New York, especially onthe coastal islands. However, cases have occurred inother parts of the United States. Because of tick activity,the risk for babesiosis is highest during June and July.Ticks are small, blood-sucking arachnids. Althoughsome ticks carry disease-causing organisms, most do not.Babesia microtiis spread to humans through the bite ofthe tick Ixodes scapularis(also called Ixodes dammini). Ixodes scapularis, called the “blacklegged deer tick,” usu-ally feeds on deer and mice. A tick picks up the parasitesby feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them onby biting a new host, possibly a human. To pass on theparasites, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48hours. Once in the bloodstream,Babesia microtienters a red blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroysthe cell. Humans infected with Babesia microtiproduce antibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the infection.
Causes and symptoms
Babesia microtilive and divide within red bloodcells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. Themajority of people who are infected have no visiblesymptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appearone to six weeks following the tick bite. Because theticks are small, many patients have no recollection of atick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired-ness, loss of appetite,fever, drenching sweats, and mus-cle pain. Nausea, vomiting,headache, shaking chills,blood in the urine, and depression can occur.Persons who are over 40 years old, have had theirspleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a seriousdisease (cancer,AIDS, etc.) are at a greater risk forsevere babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up to85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes aserious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency.
Diagnosis
Babesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a bloodsample microscopically and detecting the presence ofBabesia microtiwithin the blood cells. The blood can alsobe checked for the presence of antibodies to the parasite.
Treatment
In serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a combi-nation of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine. Clin-damycin is given by injection and quinine is given orallythree to four times a day for four to seven days. Toreduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely illpatients have been treated with blood transfusions.
Prognosis
Otherwise healthy patients will recover completely.Babesiosis may last several months without treatmentand is a severe, potentially fatal disease in splenec-tomized patients.
Prevention
The only prevention for babesiosis is to minimizeexposure to ticks by staying on trails when walkingB

Removea tick as soon as possible by grasping the tick with tweez-ers and gently pulling. Splenectomized people shouldavoid northeastern coastal regions during the tick season.Resources

Bacillary angiomatosis
Definition
A life-threatening but curable infection that causesan eruption of purple lesions on or under the skin thatresemble Kaposi’s sarcoma. The infection, whichoccurs almost exclusively in patients with AIDS, can be a complication of cat-scratch disease.
Description
Bacillary angiomatosis is a re-emerging bacterialinfection that is identical or closely related to one whichcommonly afflicted thousands of soldiers during WorldWar I. Today, the disease, caused by two versions of theKEY TERMS
Anemia—A below normal number of red bloodcells in the bloodstream.Parasite—An organism that lives upon or withinanother organism.same bacteria, is linked to homeless AIDS patients and tothose afflicted with cat-scratch disease.The infection is rarely seen today in patients whodon’t have HIV . According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV patient diag-nosed with bacillary angiomatosis is considered to haveprogressed to full-blown AIDS.
Causes and symptoms
Scientists have recently isolated two varieties of theBartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomato-sis:Bartonella(formerly Rochalimaeaquintana) and B. henselae(cause of cat-scratch disease).B. quintanainfection is known popularly as trench fever, and is the infection associated with body lice thatsickened European troops during World War I. Lice carrythe bacteria, and can transmit the infection to humans.The incidence of trench feverwas believed to have fadedaway with the end of World War I. It was not diagnosedin the United States until 1992, when 10 cases werereported among homeless Seattle men.The related bacteria B. henselaewas first identifiedseveral years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever. It alsocan lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS patients.Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is trans-mitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.These two different types of bacteria both causebacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterizedby wildly proliferating blood vessels that form tumor-likemasses in the skin and organs. The nodules that appear inbacillary angiomatosis are firm and don’t turn white whenpressed. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, innumbers ranging from one to 100. They are rarely foundon palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or in the mouth.As the number of lesions increase, the patient may devel-op a high fever, sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting,and weight loss. If untreated, infection may be fatal.In addition to the basic disease process, the two dif-ferent types of bacteria cause some slightly differentsymptoms. Patients infected with B. henselaealso expe-rience blood-filled cysts within the liver and abnormalliver function, whereas B. quintanapatients may havetumor growths in the bone.
Diagnosis
This life-threatening but curable infection is oftenmisdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other con-ditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma). A blood test devel-oped in 1992 by the CDC detects antibodies to the bacte-ria. It can be confirmed by reviewing symptoms, history
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 434Bacillary angiomatosisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 434and negative tests for other diseases that cause swollenlymph glands. It isn’t necessary to biopsy a small sampleof the lymph node unless there is a question of cancerof the lymph node or some other disease.
Treatment
Recent research indicates that antibioticsused to treat other HIV opportunistic infections can both preventand treat bacillary angiomatosis. Treatment is usuallygiven until the lesions disappear, which typically takesthree or four weeks. A severely affected lymph node orblister may have to be drained, and a heating pad mayhelp swollen, tender lymph glands. Acetaminophen(Tylenol) may relieve pain, aches, and fever over 101°F(38.3°C).
Prognosis
In most cases, prompt antibiotic treatment inpatients with AIDS cured the infection caused by eithervariety of the bacteria, and patients may resume normallife. Early diagnosis is crucial to a cure.
Prevention
Studies suggest that antibiotics may prevent the dis-ease. Patients also should be sure to treat cats for fleas.Resources

Definition
Bacteremia is an invasion of the bloodstream bybacteria.
Description
Bacteremia occurs when bacteria enter the blood-stream. This may occur through a wound or infection, orthrough a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremiamay cause no symptoms and resolve without treatment,or it may produce feverand other symptoms of infection.In some cases, bacteremia leads to septic shock, a poten- tially life-threatening condition.
Causes and symptoms
CausesSeveral types of bacteria live on the surface of theskin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,lower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. Thesebacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept incheck by the body’s natural barriers and the immune sys-tem. People in good health with strong immune systemsrarely develop bacteremia. However, when bacteria areintroduced directly into the circulatory system, especial-ly in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive med-ical treatment, the immune system may not be able tocope with the invasion, and symptoms of bacteremia maydevelop. For this reason, bacteremia is most common inpeople who are already affected by or being treated forsome other medical problem. In addition, medical treat-ment may bring a person in contact with new types ofbacteria that are more invasive than those already resid-ing in that person’s body, further increasing the likeli-hood of bacterial infection.Conditions which increase the chances of develop-ing bacteremia include:• immune suppression, either due to HIV infection ordrug therapy• antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bacteri-al types in the body• prolonged or severe illness• alcoholism or other drug abuse• malnutrition• diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in theintestines, e.g. chemotherapyfor cancerCommon immediate causes of bacteremia include:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 435BacteremiaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 435• drainage of an abscess, including an abscessed tooth.• urinary tract infection, especially in the presence of abladder catheter.• decubitus ulcers (pressure sores).• intravenous procedures using unsterilized needles,including IV drug use.• prolonged IV needle placement.• use of ostomytubes, including gastrostomy(surgicallymaking a new opening into the stomach), jejunostomy(surgically making an opening from the abdominal wallinto the jejunum), and colostomy(surgically creatingan articifical opening into the colon).The bacteria most likely to cause bacteremia includemembers of the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudo-monas, Haemophilus,and Esherichia coli(E. coli) genera.SymptomsSymptoms of bacteremia may include:• fever over 101°F (38.3°C)• chills• malaise• abdominal pain• nausea• vomiting• diarrhea• anxiety• shortness of breath• confusionNot all of these symptoms are usually present. In theelderly, confusion may be the only prominent symptom.Bacteremia may lead to septic shock, whose symptomsinclude decreased consciousness, rapid heart and breath-ing rates and multiple organ failures.
Diagnosis
Bacteremia is diagnosed by culturing the blood forbacteria. Samples may need to be tested several timesover several hours. Blood analysis may also reveal anelevated number of white blood cells. Blood pressure ismonitored closely; a decline in blood pressure may indi-cate the onset of septic shock.
Treatment
Antibioticsare the mainstay of treatment, and areoften begun before positive identification of the bacteriais made. Close observation is required to guard againstKEY TERMS
Colostomy—Surgical creation of an artificial anuson the abdominal wall by cutting into the colonand bringing it up to the surface.Gastrostomy—Surgical creation of an artificialopening into the stomach through the abdominalwall to allow tube feeding.Jejunostomy—Surgical creation of an opening tothe middle portion of the small intestine(jejunum), through the abdominal wall.Septic shock—A life-threatening drop in bloodpressure caused by bacterial infection.septic shock. Since bacteremia is usually associated withan existing infection elsewhere in the body, finding andtreating this infection is an important part of treatment.Bacteremia may cause no symptoms, but may be dis-covered through a blood test for another condition. In thissituation, it may not need to be treated, except in patientsespecially at risk for infection, such as those with heartvalve defects or whose immune systems are suppressed.
Prognosis
Prompt antibiotic therapy usually succeeds in clear-ing bacteria from the bloodstream. Recurrence may indi-cate an undiscovered site of infection. Untreated bacteriain the blood may spread, causing infection of the heart(endocarditisor pericarditis) or infection of the cover-ing of the central nervous system (meningitis).
Prevention
Bacteremia can be prevented by preventing theinfections which often precede it. Good personalhygiene, especially during viral illness, may reduce therisk of developing bacterial infection. Treating bacterialinfections quickly and thoroughly can minimize the riskof spreading infection. During medical procedures, theburden falls on medical professionals to minimize thenumber and duration of invasive procedures, to reducepatients’ exposure to sources of bacteria when beingtreated, and to use scrupulous technique.Resources

Bad breath
Definition
Bad breath, sometimes called halitosis, is anunpleasant odor of the breath.
Description
Bad breath is likely to be experienced by most adultsat least occasionally. Bad breath, either real or imagined,can have a significant impact on a person’s social andprofessional life.
Causes and symptoms
Bad breath can be caused by a number of problems.Oral diseases, fermentation of food particles in themouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can allcontribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases, suchas lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver disease,can also cause bad breath, though rarely. Many peoplethink that bad breath can originate in the stomach orintestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual-ly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carryodor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breathbeing caused from air continually escaping from thestomach is remote. Cigarette smoke can cause badbreath, not only in the cigarette smoker, but also in onewho is constantly exposed to second-hand smoke.
Diagnosis
The easiest way to determine if one has bad breath isto ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete. This isusually not too difficult. Another, more private, method ofdetermining if one has bad breath is to lick one’s wrist,wait until it dries, then smell the area. Scraping the reararea of the tongue with a plastic spoon, then smelling thespoon, is another method one can use to assess bad breath.KEY TERMS
Halitosis—The medical term for bad breath.
Treatment
The most effective treatment of bad breath is to treatthe cause. Poor oral hygienecan be improved by regularbrushing and flossing, as well as regular dental checkups.Gentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oralhygiene. In addition to good oral hygiene, the judicioususe of mouthwashes is helpful. Mouth dryness, experi-enced at night or during fasting, or due to certain med-ications and medical conditions, can contribute to badbreath. Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequateamounts of water. Chewing gum may be beneficial.As mentioned, some medications, such as some highblood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth. If this problem is significant, a medication change, under thesupervision of one’s health care provider, may improvethe dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infections, oncediagnosed, can be treated medically, usually with antibi- otics. Lung infections and kidney or liver problems will,of course, need medical treatment
Alternative treatment
Depending on the cause, a multitude of alternativetherapeutic remedies can be used. For example, sinusitis can be treated with steam inhalation of essential oilsand/or herbs.
Prognosis
Most bad breath can be treated successfully withgood oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally, forpatients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,some delusional or obsessive behavior pattern might per-tain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.Resources

Balance and coordination tests
Definition
Balance is the ability to maintain a position. Coordi-nation is the capacity to move through a complex set ofmovements. Balance and coordination depend on theinteraction of multiple body organs and systems includ-ing the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovas-cular system, and muscles. Tests or examination of anyor all of these organs or systems may be necessary todetermine the causes of loss of balance,dizziness, or the inability to coordinate movement or activities.
Purpose
Tests of balance and coordination, and the examina-tion of the organs and systems that influence balance andcoordination, can help to identify causes of dizziness,fainting, falling, or incoordination.
Precautions
Tests for balance and coordination should be con-ducted in a safe and controlled area where patients willnot experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.
Description
Assessment of balance and coordination can includediscussion of the patient’s medical history and a com-plete physical examinationincluding evaluation of theheart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart rate, orvery low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory sys-tem problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. Dur-ing the examination, the patient may be asked to rotatethe head from side to side while sitting up or while lyingdown with the head and neck extended over the edge ofthe examination table. If these tests produce dizziness ora rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystagmus), the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear, which isresponsible for maintaining balance.An examination of the eyes and ears may also giveclues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. Thepatient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distantpoint or object, and to look up, down, left, and right mov-ing only the eyes while the eyes are examined. Problemswith vision may, in themselves, contribute to balance andcoordination disturbances, or may indicate more seriousproblems of the nervous system or brain function. Hear- ing loss, fluid in the inner ear, or ear infection mightindicate the cause of balance and coordination problems.Various physical tests may also be used. A patientmay be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,or touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance. Thepatient may be asked to squeeze or push against thedoctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand ontiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects ofthese tests include holding positions for a certain num-ber of seconds, successfully repeating movements acertain number of times, and repeating the test accu-rately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may alsobe tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the knees,ankles, and elbows with a small rubber mallet to testnervous system functioning. These tests may reveal

Preparation
No special preparation is required prior to adminis-tration of balance and coordination tests. The patientmay be asked to disrobe and put on an examination gownto make it easier for the doctor to observe muscles andreflex responses.
Aftercare
No special aftercare is generally required, however,some of the tests may cause episodes of dizziness orincoordination. Patients may need to use caution inreturning to normal activities if they are experiencing anysymptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness.
Risks
These simple tests of balance and coordination aregenerally harmless.
Normal results
Under normal conditions, these test will not causedizziness, loss of balance, or incoordination.
Abnormal results
The presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, loss ofcoordination, unusual eye movements, muscle weakness,or impaired reflexes are abnormal results and may indi-cate the problem causing the loss of balance or incoordi-nation. In some cases, additional testing may be needed todiagnose the cause of balance or coordination problems.Resources

Balanitis
Definition
Balanitis is an inflammation of the head and fore-skin of the penis.
Description
Balanitis generally affects uncircumcised males. Theseare men who have a foreskin, which is the “hood” of softskin that partially covers the head of the penis. In balanitis,the head and foreskin become red and inflamed. (In circum-cised men, who lack a foreskin, these symptoms only affectthe tip of the penis.) The condition often occurs due to thefungus Candida albicans, the same organism that causesvaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is alsoreferred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a variety ofother fungal or bacterial infections, or may occur due to asensitivity reaction to common chemical agents.Uncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitisdue to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of theforeskin around the top of the penis tends to create adamp, warm environment that encourages the growth ofmicroorganisms. Most of the organisms associated withbalanitis are already present on the penis, but in verysmall numbers. However, if the area between the headand foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regularbasis, these organisms can multiply and lead to infection.Diabetes can increase the risk of developing the con-dition.
Causes and symptoms
Balanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—forexample, neglecting to bathe for several days. A failure

In other cases, bal-anitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some menmay be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps, laun-dry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who con-tract a sexually transmitted disease(STD) such astrichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.The symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore-skin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only thehead is affected). These include redness, inflammation,pain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty retract-ing the foreskin.
Diagnosis
Balanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi- cal examination. This may be conducted by your regularhealth care provider or by a urologist, the type of doctorwho specializes in such disorders. The doctor may take asample of the discharge (if any) to determine the nature ofthe possible infection. A urine test may be recommendedto evaluate glucose (sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitistreatment is typically covered by medical insurance.
Treatment
The treatment of balanitis depends on the specificcause, which can vary from case to case. Antibioticsare used to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun-gals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused byCandida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, thegoal is to identify the chemical agent responsible. Oint-ments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.No matter what the cause, it is important to thor-oughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to allevi-ate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring, or if theinflammation is interfering with urination,circumcisionmay be advised.
Alternative treatment
According to practitioners of alternative medicine,certain herbs may be effective in controlling or prevent-ing yeast infections—a common cause of balanitis.These remedies include garlic, calendula, and gold-enseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may alsohelp to clear up a Candidainfection.
Prognosis
Most cases go away quickly once the cause is identi-fied and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis canresult in urethral stricture.KEY TERMS
Acidophilus—A bacteria believed to combat yeastinfections.Circumcision—The surgical removal of the fore-skin.Urethral stricture—A narrowing of the urethra(urine tube).
Prevention
Proper hygiene is the best way to avoid balanitis.Circumcision is sometimes performed to prevent repeat-ed cases.Resources

Balantidiasis
Definition
Balantidiasis is an infectious disease produced by asingle-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Balan- tidium colithat infects the digestive tract. It is primarily adisease of the tropics, although it is also found in cooler,temperate climates. Most persons with balantidiasis donot exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic),but a few individuals will develop diarrheawith bloodand mucus and an inflamed colon (colitis).
Description
Balantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli, a para- sitic protozoan that infects the large intestine. B. coliis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 440BalantidiasisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 440the largest and only protozoan, having cilia or hair-likestructures, that is capable of causing disease in humans.Balantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas with poorsanitation and in settings where humans live in closecontact with pigs, sheep, or goats.
Causes and symptoms
Balantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating foodor drinking water that has been contaminated by humanor animal feces containing B. colicysts. During its lifecycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: theinfective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move butcan survive outside the human body because of its thick,protective covering; and the disease-producing form, thetrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannotinfect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport-ed to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are brokenopen by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho-zoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho-zoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or byinvading the lining of the large intestine. Within the liningof the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substancethat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) orabscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts thatare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in thefeces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-tions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks tomonths, ready to begin the cycle again.Most individuals with balantidiasis have no notice-able symptoms. Even though these individuals may notfeel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by per-son-to-person contact or by contaminating food or waterwith cysts that others may ingest, for example, by prepar-ing food with unwashed hands.The most common symptoms of balantidiasis arechronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal cramps,pain, and bloody stools. Complications may includeintestinal perforation in which the intestinal wallbecomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to otherparts of the body in the blood stream.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar dis-eases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms mayor may not be present. A diagnosis of balantidiasis may beconsidered when a patient has diarrhea combined with apossible history of recent exposure to amebiasisthrough travel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse.Specifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made byfinding B. colicysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stoolsor by finding trophozoites in tissue samples (biopsy)taken from the large bowel. A diagnostic blood test hasnot yet been developed.Stool examinationThis test involves microscopically examining a stoolsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of B. coli.SigmoidoscopyTo take a tissue sample from the large intestine, aprocedure called a sigmoidoscopyis performed. Duringa sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument is used tovisually examine the intestinal lining and obtain smalltissue specimens.Treatment
Patients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip-tion medication, typically consisting of a ten day courseof either tetracycline or metronidazole. Alternative drugsthat have proven effective in treating balantidiasisinclude iodoquinol or paromomycin.
Prognosis
Although somewhat dependent on the patient’s over-all health, in general, the prognosis for most patients withbalantidiasis is good. Severely infected patients occa-sionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wall(intestinal perforation) and consequent loss of blood.
Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medica-tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-vent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had thedisease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effec-tive personal and community hygiene. Specific safe-guards include the following:• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified byfiltering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.• Proper food handling. Measures include protectingfood from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom andbefore cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countrieswith high rates of balantidiasis.• Careful disposal of human feces.• Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients. Thestools of family members and sexual partners of infect-ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts ortrophozoites.

Balloon valvuloplasty
Definition
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a nar-rowed heart valve is stretched open using a procedurethat does not require open heart surgery.KEY TERMS
Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease andare usually capable of transmitting the disease butwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease aresaid to be asymptomatic.Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for diag-nostic purposes.Ciliated—Covered with short, hair-like protru-sions, like B. coliand certain other protozoa. Thecilia or hairs help the organism to move.Colitis—An inflammation of the large intestinethat occurs in some cases of balantidiasis. It ismarked by cramping pain and the passing ofbloody mucus.Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopicorganism, such as B. coli, that is eukaryotic and,therefore, different from bacteria (prokaryotic).Sigmoidoscopy—A procedure in which a thin,flexible, lighted instrument, called a sigmoido-scope, is used to visually examine the lower partof the large intestine.Purpose
There are four valves in the heart, which are locatedat the exit of each of the four chambers of the heart. Theyare called aortic valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve,and tricuspid valve. The valves open and close to regu-late the blood flow from one chamber to the next. Theyare vital to the efficient functioning of the heart.In some people the valves are too narrow (a condi-tion called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performedon children and adults to improve valve function andblood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treat-ment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary stenosis. Balloonvalvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for nar-rowed pulmonary valves. Results in treating narrowingof the mitral valve are generally good. It is more difficultto perform and less successful in treating narrowing ofthe aortic valve.
Description
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thintube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at the tipis inserted through the skin in the groin area into a bloodvessel, and then is threaded up to the opening of the nar-rowed heart valve. The balloon is inflated, which stretch-es the valve open. This procedure cures many valveobstructions. It is also called balloon enlargement of anarrowed heart valve.The procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza-tionlaboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient isusually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the areawhere the catheter is inserted numb. After the site where thecatheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized, thecardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood ves-sel, then passes a balloon-tipped catheter through the firstcatheter. Guided by a video monitor and an x ray, the physi-cian slowly threads the catheter into the heart. The deflatedballoon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflatedrepeatedly. The inflated balloon widens the valve’s openingby splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve iswidened, the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The othercatheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in somecases the procedure must be repeated.
Preparation
For at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty,the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anything.An intravenous line is inserted so that medications can beadministered. The patient’s groin area is shaved andcleaned with an antiseptic. About an hour before the pro-cedure, the patient is given an oral sedative such asdiazepam (Valium).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 442Balloon valvuloplastyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 442Aftercare
After balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is sent to therecovery room for several hours, where he or she is moni-tored for vital signs (such as pulse and breathing) and heartsounds. An electrocardiogram, which is a record of theelectrical impulses in the heart, is done. The leg in whichthe catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented frommoving. The skin condition is monitored. The insertionsite, which will be covered by a sandbag, is observed forbleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluidswill be given to help eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenousblood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronaryarteries may be given. Painmedication is available.For at least 30 minutes after removal of the catheter,direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after thisa pressure dressing will be applied. Following dischargefrom the hospital, the patient can usually resume normalactivities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong follow-upis necessary because valves sometimes degenerate ornarrowing recurs, making surgery necessary.
Risks
Balloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica-tions. For example, the valve can become misshapen sothat it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condi-tion worse. Embolism, where pieces of the valve breakoff and travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possiblerisk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valveleaflets, immediate surgery is required. Less frequentcomplications are bleeding and hematoma (a local col-lection of clotted blood) at the puncture site, abnormalheart rhythms, reduced blood flow,heart attack, heart puncture, infection, and circulatory problems.Resources

Barbiturate-induced coma
Definition
A barbiturate-induced coma, or barb coma, is a tem-porary state of unconsciousness brought on by a con-trolled dose of a barbiturate drug, usually pentobarbitalor thiopental.
Purpose
Barbiturate comas are used to protect the brain dur-ing major brain surgery, such as the removal of arteri- ovenous malformationsor aneurysms. Coma may alsobe induced to control intracranial hypertensioncaused by brain injury.
Precautions
Barbiturate-induced comas are used when conven-tional therapy to reduce intracranial hypertension hasfailed. Barbiturate dosing is geared toward burst suppres-sion—that is, reducing brain activity as measured byelectroencephalography. This reduction in brain activi-ty has to be balanced against the potential side effects ofbarbiturates, which include allergic reactions andeffects on the cardiovascular system.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 443Barbiturate-induced comaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 443Description
One of the greatest hazards associated with braininjury is intracranial hypertension. Brain injury may becaused by an accidental head injuryor a medical condi-tion, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the brainis injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing it toswell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of thebrain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.If the pressure does not abate, oxygenated bloodmay not reach all areas of the brain. Also, the brain tissuemay be forced against hard, bony edges on the interior ofthe skull. In either case, the brain tissue may die, causingpermanent brain damage or death.Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tis-sue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these reduc-tions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow, decreasingthe amount of swelling in the brain. With the swellingrelieved, the pressure decreases and some or all braindamage may be averted.Controversy exists, however, over the benefits ofusing barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension.Some studies have shown that barbiturate-induced comacan reduce intracranial hypertension but does not neces-KEY TERMS
Aneurysm—A bulge or sack-like projection from ablood vessel.Arteriovenous malformation—An abnormal tan-gle of arteries and veins in which the arteries feeddirectly into the veins without a normal interven-ing capillary bed.Diuretic agent—A drug which increases urine out-put.Electroencephalography—The recording of elec-trical potentials produced by the brain. Thesepotentials indicate brain activity.Hyperventilation—A respiratory therapy involvingdeeper and/or faster breathing to keep the carbondioxide pressure in the blood below normal.Intracranial hypertension—Abnormally high bloodpressure within the skull.Osmotherapy—Intravenous injection or oraladministration of an agent that induces dehydra-tion. The goal of dehydration is to reduce theamount of accumulated fluid in the brain.Steroid—A type of drug used to reduce swelling.sarily prevent brain damage. Furthermore, the reductionin intracranial hypertension may not be sustained.Preparation
Inducing a barbiturate coma is usually kept inreserve for cases in which conventional treatments forcontrolling intracranial hypertension have failed.Before coma is induced, intracranial hypertension maybe treated by hyperventilation; by facilitation of bloodflow from the brain; by decompressive surgical proce-dures, such as draining excess fluids from under theskull or from the chambers within the brain (ventricles);or by drug therapy, including osmotherapy, diureticagents, or steroids.
Risks
An estimated 25% of barbiturate-induced comas areaccompanied by severe side effects. The side effects ofbarbiturates, especially the depressive effect on the car-diovascular system, can be too risky for some patients.Other side effects include impaired gastrointestinalmotility and impaired immune response and infection.Since barbiturates depress activity in the brain, measure-ments of brain activity may be unreliable. Careful moni-toring of the patient is required to ensure nutritionalneeds are being met and to guard against complications,such as lung infection, fevers, or deep vein blood clots.
Normal results
In many patients who do not respond to convention-al therapy, barbiturate-induced coma can achieve thenecessary control of intracranial hypertension.Resources

Definition
Barbiturates are medicines that act on the central ner-vous system and cause drowsiness and can control seizures.
Purpose
Barbiturates are in the group of medicines known ascentral nervous system depressants(CNS). Also knownas sedative-hypnotic drugs, barbiturates make people veryrelaxed, calm, and sleepy. These drugs are sometimesused to help patients relax before surgery. Some may alsobe used to control seizures (convulsions). Although barbi-turates have been used to treat nervousness and sleepproblems, they have generally been replaced by othermedicines for these purposes.These medicines may become habit forming andshould not be used to relieve everyday anxietyand ten- sion or to treat sleeplessness over long periods.
Description
Barbiturates are available only with a physician’sprescription and are sold in capsule, tablet, liquid, andinjectable forms. Some commonly used barbiturates arephenobarbital (Barbita) and secobarbital (Seconal).
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of barbi-turate and other factors such as the patient’s age and thecondition for which the medicine is being taken. Checkwith the physician who prescribed the drug or the phar-macist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.Always take barbiturates exactly as directed. Nevertake larger or more frequent doses, and do not take thedrug for longer than directed. If the medicine does notseem to be working, even after taking it for severalweeks, do not increase the dosage. Instead, check withthe physician who prescribed the medicine.Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly withoutfirst checking with the physician who prescribed it. Itmay be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce thechance of withdrawal symptoms. If it is necessary to stoptaking the drug, check with the physician for instructionson how to stop.
Precautions
See a physician regularly while taking barbiturates.The physician will check to make sure the medicine isworking as it should and will note unwanted side effects.Because barbiturates work on the central nervoussystem, they may add to the effects of alcohol and otherdrugs that slow the central nervous system, such as anti- histamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids,medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some painrelievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the effectsof anesthetics, including those used for dental proce-dures. The combined effects of barbiturates and alcoholor other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the centralnervous system) can be very dangerous, leading tounconsciousness or even death. Anyone taking barbitu-rates should not drink alcohol and should check with hisor her physician before taking any medicines classifiedas CNS depressants.Taking an overdose of barbiturates or combiningbarbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous systemdepressants can cause unconsciousness and even death.Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or a reaction tocombining barbiturates with alcohol or other drugsshould get emergency medical help immediately. Signsinclude:• severe drowsiness• breathing problems• slurred speech• staggering• slow heartbeat• severe confusion• severe weaknessBarbiturates may change the results of certain med-ical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking thismedicine should alert the health care professional incharge.People may feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or lessalert when using these drugs. These effects may evenoccur the morning after taking a barbiturate at bedtime.Because of these possible effects, anyone who takesthese drugs should not drive, use machines or do any-thing else that might be dangerous until they have foundout how the drugs affect them.Barbiturates may cause physical or mental depen-dence when taken over long periods. Anyone who showsthese signs of dependence should check with his or herphysician right away:• the need to take larger and larger doses of the medicineto get the same effect• a strong desire to keep taking the medicine• withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea or vom-iting, convulsions, trembling, or sleep problems, whenthe medicine is stopped
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 445BarbituratesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 445Children may be especially sensitive to barbiturates.This may increase the chance of side effects such asunusual excitement.Older people may also be more sensitive that othersto the effects of this medicine. In older people, barbitu-rates may be more likely to cause confusion, depression,and unusual excitement. These effects are also more like-ly in people who are very ill.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake barbiturates. Before taking these drugs, be sure to letthe physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto barbiturates in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes,preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Taking barbiturates during pregnancyincreases the chance of birth defectsand may causeother problems such as prolonged labor and withdrawaleffects in the baby after birth. Pregnant women who musttake barbiturates for serious or life-threatening condi-tions should thoroughly discuss with their physicians thebenefits and risks of taking this medicine.
BREASTFEEDING. Barbiturates pass into breast milkand may cause problems such as drowsiness, breathingproblems, or slow heartbeat in nursing babies whosemothers take the medicine. Women who are breastfeed-ing should check with their physicians before using bar-biturates.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using barbi-turates, people with any of these medical problems shouldmake sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:• alcohol or drug abuse• depression• hyperactivity (in children)• pain• kidney disease• liver disease• diabetes• overactive thyroid• underactive adrenal gland• chronic lung diseases such as asthmaor emphysema• severe anemia• porphyriaUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking barbiturateswith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, light- headedness, drowsiness, and clumsiness or unsteadiness.These problems usually go away as the body adjusts tothe drug and do not require medical treatment unless theypersist or interfere with normal activities.More serious side effects are not common, but mayoccur. If any of the following side effects occur, check withthe physician who prescribed the medicine immediately:•fever• muscle or joint pain• sore throat• chest pain or tightness in the chest• wheezing• skin problems, such as rash,hives, or red, thickened, orscaly skin• bleeding sores on the lips• sores or painful white spots in the mouth• swollen eyelids, face, or lipsIn addition, check with a physician as soon as possi-ble if confusion, depression, or unusual excitement occurafter taking barbiturates.Patients who take barbiturates for a long time or athigh doses may notice side effects for some time afterthey stop taking the drug. These effects usually appearwithin 8-16 hours after the patient stops taking the medi-cine. Check with a physician if these or other trouble-some symptoms occur after stopping treatment with bar-biturates:• dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness• anxiety or restlessness•hallucinations• vision problems• nausea and vomiting• seizures (convulsions)• muscle twitches or trembling hands• weakness• sleep problems, nightmares, or increased dreamingOther side effects may occur. Anyone who hasunusual symptoms during or after treatment with barbitu-rates should get in touch with his or her physician.

Barium enema
Definition
A barium enema, also known as a lower GI (gastroin-testinal) exam, is a test that uses x-ray examination toview the large intestine. There are two types of this test:the single-contrast technique where barium sulfate isinjected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view ofthe large intestine; and the double-contrast (or “air con-trast”) technique where air is inserted into the rectum.
Purpose
A barium enema may be performed for a variety ofreasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon andrectal cancer(or colorectal cancer), and inflammatorydisease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the tis-sue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a pouchpushing out from the colon), and structural changes inthe large intestine can also be established with this test.The double-contrast barium enema is the best method fordetecting small tumors (such as polyps), early inflamma-tory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.The decision to perform a barium enema is based on aperson’s history of altered bowel habits. These can includediarrhea,constipation, any lower abdominal painthey are currently exhibiting, blood, mucus, or pus in theirstools. It is also recommended that this exam be used everyfive to 10 years to screen healthy people for colorectal can-cer, the second most deadly type of tumor in the UnitedStates. Those who have a close relative with colorectal can-cer or have had a precancerous polyp are considered to be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 447Barium enemaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 447at an increased risk for the disease and should be screenedmore frequently to look for abnormalities.
Precautions
While barium enema is an effective screeningmethod in the detection of symptoms and may lead to atimely diagnosis of several diseases, it is not the onlymethod to do this. As of 1997, some studies have shownthat the colonoscopyprocedure performed by experi-enced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diag-nostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer.A colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physi-cian to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps. Ifabnormalities are seen at this time the procedure isaccompanied by a biopsy. Some physicians use sigmoi- doscopyplus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy.
Description
To begin a barium enema, the patient will lie withtheir back down on a tilting radiographic table in order tohave x rays of the abdomen taken. After being assisted toa different position, a well-lubricated rectal tube is insert-ed through the anus. This tube allows the physician orassistant to slowly administer the barium into the intes-tine. While this filling process is closely monitored, it isimportant for the patient to keep the anus tightly con-tracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its posi-tion and prevent the barium from leaking. This step isemphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that maybe caused if the barium leaks. A rectal balloon may alsobe inflated to help retain the barium. The table may betilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid inthe filling process.As the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomenare taken to distinguish significant findings.There are manyways to perform a barium enema. One way is that shortlyafter filling, the rectal tube is removed and the patientexpels as much of the barium as possible. Upon completingthis, an additional x ray is taken,and a double-contrastenema may follow. If this is done immediately, a thinfilm of barium will remain in the intestine, and air isthen slowly injected to expand the bowel lumen.Sometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air isinjected.
Preparation
In order to conduct the most accurate barium enematest, the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowelpreparation instructions prior to the test. This preparationcommonly includes restricted intake of diary productsand a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the test, in additionto drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids 12–24hours before the test. Patients may also be given laxa- tives, and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema.In addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara-tion prior to the test, the patient can expect the followingduring a barium enema:• They will be well draped with a gown as they aresecured to a tilting x-ray table.• As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, theymay experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate.• The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep breathsthrough the mouth to ease any discomfort.Aftercare
Patients should follow several steps immediatelyafter undergoing a barium enema, including:• Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat-ing effects of bowel preparation and the test.• Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel prepa-ration taken before it can be exhausting.• A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate anyremaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be preva-lent for the next 24-72 hours following the test.
Risks
While a barium enema is considered a safe screen-ing test used on a routine basis, it can cause complica-tions in certain people. The following indications shouldbe kept in mind before a barium enema is performed:• Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerativecolitis, toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation inthe intestine should not undergo a barium enema.• The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has ablocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, orsevere bloody diarrhea.• Complications that may be caused by the test includeperforation of the colon, water intoxication, bariumgranulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction.These are all very rare.
Normal results
When the patient undergoes a single-contrast enema,their intestine is steadily filled with barium to differenti-ate the colon’s markings. A normal result displays uni-form filling of the colon. As the barium is expelled, theintestinal walls collapse. A normal result on the x rayafter defecation will show the intestinal lining as havinga standard, feathery appearance.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 448Barium enemaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 448Accordingly, the double-contrast enema expands theintestine which is already lined with a thin layer of bari-um, but with air to display a detailed image of themucosal pattern. Varying positions taken by the patientallow the barium to collect on the dependent walls of theintestine by way of gravity.
Abnormal results
A barium enema allows abnormalities to appear on anx ray that may aid in the diagnosis of several different con-ditions. Although most colon cancers occur in the rectosig-moid region, or upper part of the rectum and adjoiningportion of the sigmoid colon, and are better detected with adifferent test called a proctosigmoidoscopy, an enema canidentify other early signs of cancer.Identification of polyps, diverticulosis, inflammato-ry disease, such as diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis isattainable through a barium x ray. Structural changes inthe intestine,gastroenteritis, and some cases of acuteappendicitismay also be apparent by viewing this x ray.Resources

Bartholin’s gland cyst
Definition
A Bartholin’s gland cyst is a swollen fluid-filled lumpthat develops from a blockage of one of the Bartholin’sglands, which are small glands located on each side of theopening to the vagina. Bartholin’s gland cysts and abscess-es are commonly found in women of reproductive age,developing in approximately 2% of all women.
Description
The Bartholin’s glands are located in the lips of thelabia that cover the vaginal opening. The glands (normal-ly the size of a pea) provide moisture for the vulva area.A Bartholin’s gland cyst may form in the gland itself orin the duct draining the gland. A cyst normally does notcause pain, grows slowly, and may go away withouttreatment. It usually ranges in size from 0.4-1.2 in (1–3cm), although some may grow much larger.If infected, a Bartholin’s gland cyst can form anabscessthat will increase in size over several days and isvery painful. In order to heal, a Bartholin’s gland cystusually must be drained.
Causes and symptoms
A Bartholin’s gland cyst occurs if the duct becomesblocked for any reason, such as infection, injury, orchronic inflammation. Very rarely a cyst is caused bycancer, which usually occurs only in women over theage of 40. In many cases, the cause of a Bartholin’s glandcyst is unknown.Symptoms of an uninfected Bartholin’s gland cystinclude a painless lump on one side of the vulva area(most common symptom) and redness or swelling in thevulva area.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 449Bartholin’s gland cystGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 449Symptoms of an abscessed Bartholin’s gland include:• pain that occurs with walking, sitting, physical activity,or sexual intercourse• fever and chills• increased swelling in the vulva area over a two- to four-day period• drainage from the cyst, normally occurring four to fivedays after the swelling startsAbscesses may be caused by sexually transmittedbacteria, such as those causing chlamydial or gonococcalinfections, while others are caused by bacteria normallyoccurring in the vagina. Over 60 types of bacteria havebeen found in Bartholin’s gland abscesses.
Diagnosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst or abscess is diagnosed bya gynecological pelvic exam. If the cyst appears to beinfected, a culture is often performed to identify the typeof bacteria causing the abscess.
Treatment
Treatment for this condition depends on the size ofthe cyst, whether it is painful, and whether the cyst isinfected.If the cyst is not infected, treatment options include:• watchful waiting by the woman and her health care pro-fessional• soaking of the genital area with warm towel compresses• soaking of the genital area in a sitz bathKEY TERMS
Marsupialization—Cutting out a wedge of the cystwall and putting in stitches so the cyst cannotreoccur.Sitz bath—A warm bath in which just the buttocksand genital area soak in water; used to reducepain and aid healing in the genital area.Window operation—Cutting out a large oval-shaped piece of the cyst wall and putting in stitch-es to create a window so the cyst cannot reoccur.Word catheter—A small rubber catheter with aninflatable balloon tip that is inserted into a stabincision in the cyst, after the contents of the cysthave been drained.• use of non-prescription pain medication to relieve milddiscomfortIf the Bartholin’s gland is infected, there are severaltreatments available to treat the abscess, including:• soaking of the genital area in a sitz bath• treatment with antibiotics• use of prescription or non-prescription pain medication• incision and drainage, i.e., cutting into the cyst anddraining the fluid (not usually successful, as the cystoften reoccurs)• placement of a drain (Word catheter) in the cyst for twoto four weeks so fluid can drain and prevent reoccur-rence of the cyst• marsupialization• window operation• use of a carbon dioxide laser to open the cyst and heatthe cyst wall tissue so that the cyst cannot form a sacand reoccur• incision and drainage, followed by treatment with silvernitrate to burn the cyst wall so the cyst cannot form asac and reoccur• removal of the entire Bartholin’s gland cyst, if the cysthas reoccurred several times after use of other treatmentmethodsDuring surgical treatment, the area will be numbedwith a local anesthetic to reduce pain. General anesthesiamay be used for treatment of an abscess, as the procedurecan be painful.In a pregnant woman, surgical treatment of cyststhat are asymptomatic should be delayed until afterdelivery to avoid the possibility of excessive bleeding.However, if the Bartholin’s gland is infected and mustbe drained, antibiotics and local anesthesia are generallyconsidered safe.If the cyst is caused by cancer, the gland must beexcised, and the woman should be under the care of agynecologist familiar with the treatment of this type ofcancer.
Alternative treatment
If a Bartholin’s gland cyst has no or mild symptoms,or has opened on its own to drain, a woman may decideto use watchful waiting, warm sitz baths, and non-pre-scription pain medication. If symptoms become worse ordo not improve, a health care professional should then beconsulted.Infected Bartholin’s glands should be evaluated andtreated by a health care professional.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 450Bartholin’s gland cystGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 450Prognosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst should respond to treatmentin a few days. If an abscess requires surgery, healing maytake days to weeks, depending on the size of the abscessand the type of surgical procedure used. Most of the sur-gical procedures, except for incision and drainage,should be effective in preventing recurring infections.
Prevention
There are few ways to prevent the formation ofBartholin’s gland cysts or abscesses. However, as aBartholin’s gland abscess may be caused by a sexuallytransmitted disease, the practice of safe sex is recommend-ed. Using good hygiene, i.e., wiping front to back after abowel movement, is also recommended to prevent bacteriafrom the bowels from contaminating the vaginal area.Resources

Bartonellosis
Definition
Bartonellosis is an infectious bacterial disease withan acute form (which has a sudden onset and shortcourse) and a chronic form (which has more gradualonset and longer duration). The disease is transmitted bysandflies and occurs in western South America. Charac-terized by a form of red blood cell deficiency (hemolyticanemia) and fever, the potentially fatal acute form iscalled Oroya fever or Carrion’s disease. The chronicform is identified by painful skin lesions.
Description
The acute form of the disease gets its name from anoutbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru.KEY TERMS
Acute—Referring to the course of a disease, or aphase of a disease, the short-term experience ofprominent symptoms.Chronic—Referring to the course of a disease, or aphase of a disease, the long-term experience ofprominent symptoms.Erythrocytes—Red blood cells.Hemolytic anemia—A form of erythrocyte deficien-cy caused by the destruction of the red blood cells.Host—The organism that harbors or nourishesanother organism (parasite). In bartonellosis, theperson infected with Bartonella basilliformis.Vector—An organism, such as insects or rodents,that can transmit disease to humans.More than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors laterdeveloped a skin disease, called verruga peruana (Peru-vian warts). These skin lesions were observed prior tothe 1871 outbreak—perhaps as far back as the pre-Columbian era—but a connection to Oroya fever wasunknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, DanielCarrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion tostudy the course of the skin disease. When he became illwith Oroya fever, the connection became apparent.Oroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease in honor ofhis fatal experiment.The bacteria,Bartonella bacilliformis, was isolatedby Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as thecause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonellagenus includes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which causehuman diseases, including cat-scratch diseaseand bacillary angiomatosis. However, bartonellosis refersexclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis. The disease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountainsin western South America; nearly all cases have been inPeru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involvingthousands of people occurred in 1940–41, but bartonel-losis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sand-flies, the only known disease carrier (vector), has beencredited with managing the disease.
Causes and symptoms
Bartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal sandflyand arises from infection with B. bacilliformis. The sand-fly,Lutzomyia verrucarum, dines on human blood and,in so doing, can inject bacteria into the bloodstream. The
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 451BartonellosisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 451sandfly is found only in certain areas of the PeruvianAndes; other, as-yet-unidentified vectors are suspected inEcuador and Colombia.Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria latch onto redblood cells (erythrocytes), burrow into the cells, andreproduce. In the process, up to 90% of the host’s ery-throcytes are destroyed, causing severe hemolytic ane-mia. The anemia is accompanied by high fever, muscleand joint pain,delirium, and possibly coma.Two to eight weeks after the acute phase, an infectedindividual develops verruga peruana. However, individu-als may exhibit the characteristic lesions without everexperiencing the acute phase. Left untreated, the lesionsmay last months or years. These lesions resemble blood-filled blisters, up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in diameter, and appearprimarily on the head and limbs. They can be painful tothe touch and may bleed or ulcerate.
Diagnosis
Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and thepatient’s history, such as recent travel in areas where bar-tonellosis occurs. Isolationof B. bacilliformisfrom the bloodstream or lesions can confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Antibioticsare the mainstay of bartonellosis treat-ment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics,including chloramphenicol,penicillins, and aminogly-cosides. Blood transfusions may be necessary to treat theanemia caused by bartonellosis.
Prognosis
Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatalityassociated with bartonellosis. Prior to the development ofantibiotics, the fever was fatal in 40% of cases. Withantibiotic treatment, that rate has dropped to 8%. Fatali-ties can result from complications associated with severeanemia and secondary infections. Once the infection ishalted, an individual can recover fully.
Prevention
Avoiding sandfly bites is the primary means of pre-vention. Sandfly eradication programs have been helpfulin decreasing the sandfly population, and insect repellantcan be effective in preventing sandfly bites.Resources

Battered child syndrome
Definition
Battered child syndrome refers to injuries sustainedby a child as a result of physical abuse, usually inflictedby an adult caregiver. Alternative terms include: shakenbaby; shaken baby syndrome; child abuse; and non-accidental trauma (NAT).
Description
Internal injuries, cuts,burns,bruisesand broken orfractured bones are all possible signs of battered childsyndrome. Emotional damage to a child is also often theby-product of child abuse, which can result in seriousbehavioral problems such as substance abuse or thephysical abuse of others. Approximately 14% of childrenin the United States are physically abused each year, andan estimated 2,000 of those children die as a result of theabuse. Between 1994–1995, 1.1 million cases of childabuse were recorded in the United States; of that number,55% of the victims were less than a year old.
Causes and symptoms
Battered child syndrome (BCS) is found at everylevel of society, although the incidence may be higher inlow-income households where adult caregivers suffergreater stressand social difficulties, without having hadthe benefit of higher education. The child abuser mostoften injures a child in the heat of anger, and was oftenabused as a child himself. The incessant crying of an
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 452Battered child syndromeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 452infant or child may trigger abuse. Symptoms may includea delayed visit to the emergency room with an injuredchild; an implausible explanation of the cause of a child’sinjury; bruises that match the shape of a hand, fist or belt;cigarette burns; scald marks; bite marks; black eyes;unconsciousness; bruises around the neck; and a bulgingfontanel in infants.
Diagnosis
Battered child syndrome is most often diagnosed byan emergency room physician or pediatrician, or byteachers or social workers. Physical examinationwill detect bruises, burns, swelling, retinal hemorrhages. Xrays, and other imaging techniques, such as MRI or scansmay confirm fracturesor other internal injuries. Thepresence of injuries at different stages of healing (i.e.having occurred at different times)is nearly alwaysindicative of BCS. Establishing the diagnosis is oftenhindered by the excessive cautiousness of caregivers orby actual concealment of the true origin of the child˛sinjuries, as a result of fear, shame and avoidance ordenial mechanisms.
Treatment
Medical treatment for battered child syndrome willvary according to the type of injury incurred. Counselingand the implementation of an intervention plan for thechild’s parents or guardians is necessary. The child abusermay be incarcerated, and/or the abused child removedfrom the home to prevent further harm. Reporting childabuse to authorities is mandatory for doctors, teachers,and childcare workers in most states as a way to preventcontinued abuse. Both physical and psychological therapyare often recommended as treatment for the abused child.
Prognosis
The prognosis for battered child syndrome willdepend on the severity of injury, actions taken by theauthorities to ensure the future safety of the injured child,and the willingness of parents or guardians to seek coun-seling for themselves as well as for the child.
Prevention
Recognizing the potential for child abuse in a situa-tion, and the seeking or offering of intervention andcounseling before battered child syndrome occurs is thebest way to prevent it. Signs that physical abuse may beforthcoming include parental alcohol or substance abuse;previous abuse of the child or the child’s siblings; historyof mental or emotional problems in parents; parentsKEY TERMS

Bed-wetting
Definition
Bed-wetting is the unintentional (involuntary) dis-charge of urine during the night. Although most childrenbetween the ages of three and five begin to stay dry atnight, the age at which children are physically and emo-tionally ready to maintain complete bladder controlvaries. Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the con-tinued, usually involuntary, passage of urine during thenight or the day after the age at which control is expected.
Description
Most children wet the bed occasionally, and defini-tions of the age and frequency at which bed-wettingbecomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Manyresearchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 453Bed-wettingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 453About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed aboutonce a month. More boys than girls have this problem.The American Psychiatric Association, however, definesenuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed orclothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually invol-untary but in some cases it is intentional. For a diagnosisof enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week for at leastthree months with no underlying physiological cause.Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and daytime (diur-nal), at age five affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls. Byage 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of girls; only 1% ofadolescents experience enuresis.Enuresis is divided into two classes. A child withprimary enuresis has never established bladder control. Achild with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a pro-longed dry period. Some children have both nocturnaland diurnal enuresis.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known. Ittends to run in families. Most children with primary enure-sis have a close relative—a parent, aunt, or uncle—whoalso had the disorder. About 70% of children with two par-ents who wet the bed will also wet the bed. Twin studieshave shown that both of a pair of identical twins experienceenuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins.Sometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a seriousmedical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, orepilepsy. Snoringand episodes of interrupted breathingduring sleep (sleep apnea) occasionally contribute tobed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can causethese conditions. Other physiological problems, such asurinary tract infection, severe constipation, or spinal cord injury, can cause bed-wetting.Children who wet the bed frequently may have asmaller than normal functional bladder capacity. Func-tional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a personcan hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge tourinate. When functional capacity is small, the bladderwill not hold all the urine produced during the night.Tests have shown that bladder size in these children isnormal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strongurges to urinate. Such children urinate often during thedaytime and may wet several times at night. Although asmall functional bladder capacity may be caused by adevelopmental delay, it may also be that the child’s habitof voiding frequently slows bladder development.Parents often report that their bed-wetting child is anextremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake. However,several research studies found that bed-wetting childrenhave normal sleep patterns and that bed-wetting canoccur in any stage of sleep.Recent medical research has found that many chil-dren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an impor-tant hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).ADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hours,meaning that the urine contains less water and thereforetakes up less space. This decreased volume of water usu-ally prevents the child’s bladder from overfilling duringthe night, unless the child drank a lot just before going tobed. Testing of many bed-wetting children has shownthat these children do not have the usual increase in ADHduring sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, oftenproduce more urine during the hours of sleep than theirbladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the bladderreleases the excess urine and the child wets the bed.Research demonstrates that in most cases bed-wet-ting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psy-chological problem. Children who wet the bed usuallyhave normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns thatare no different from those of non-bed-wetting children.Sometimes emotional stress, such as the birth of a sib-ling, a deathin the family, or separation from the family,may be associated with the onset of bed-wetting in a pre-viously toilet-trained child. Daytime wetting, however,may indicate that the problem has a physical cause.While most children have no long-term problems asa result of bed-wetting, some children may develop psy-chological problems. Low self-esteem may occur whenthese children, who already feel embarrassed, are furtherhumiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punishthem or who are overly aggressive about toilet training.The problem can by aggravated when playmates tease orwhen social activities such as sleep-away camp areavoided for fear of teasing.
Diagnosis
If a child continues to wet the bed after the age ofsix, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation anddiagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist(pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can make adiagnosis, a thorough medical history is obtained. Thenthe child receives a physical examination, appropriatelaboratory tests, including a urine test (urinalysis), and, if necessary, radiologic studies (such as x rays).If the child is healthy and no physical problem is found,which is the case 90% of the time, the doctor may not rec-ommend treatment but rather may provide the parents andthe child with reassurance, information, and advice.
Treatment
Occasionally a doctor will determine that the prob-lem is serious enough to require treatment. Standard
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 454Bed-wettingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 454treatments for bed-wetting include bladder trainingexercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy-chotherapy, and diet therapy.Bladder training exercises are based on the theorythat those who wet the bed have small functional bladdercapacity. Children are told to drink a large quantity ofwater and to try to prolong the periods between urina-tions. These exercises are designed to increase bladdercapacity but are only successful in resolving bed-wettingin a small number of patients.In motivational therapy, parents attempt to encour-age the child to combat bed-wetting, but the child mustwant to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such aspraise or rewards for staying dry, can help improve self-image and resolve the condition. Punishment for “wet”nights will hamper the child’s self-esteem and compoundthe problem.The following motivational techniques are common-ly used:• Behavior modification. This method of therapy isaimed at helping children take responsibility for theirnighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors.For example, children are taught to use the bathroombefore bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after din-ner. While behavior modification generally producesgood results, it is long-term treatment.• Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed inthe child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor triggersan alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wet-ness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then go tothe bathroom and finish urinating. The intention is tocondition a response to awaken when the bladder isfull. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation of bothparents and children. They are considered the mosteffective form of treatment now available.A number of drugs are also used to treat bed-wetting.These medications are usually fast acting; children oftenrespond to them within the first week of treatment. Amongthe drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmo-pressin acetate (DDA VP), a substance similar to the hor-mone that helps regulate urine production; and imipraminehydrochloride, a drug that helps to increase bladder capac-ity. Studies show that imipramine is effective for as manyas 50% of patients. However, children often wet the bedagain after the drug is discontinued, and it has some sideeffects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physicalcause can be treated by surgical procedures. These causesinclude enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea, physicaldefects in the urinary system, or a spinal tumor.Psychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibitssigns of severe emotional distress in response to eventssuch as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, achange in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also indi-cated if a child shows signs of persistently low self-esteem or depression.In rare cases,allergiesor intolerances to certainfoods—such as dairy products, citrus products, or choco-late—can cause bed-wetting. When children have foodsensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discoveringthe substances that trigger the allergic response and elim-inating these substances from the child’s diet.
Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments are available forbed-wetting.MassageAccording to practitioners of this technique, pres-sure applied to various points on the body may help alle-viate the condition. Acupressureor massage, when doneby a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-wettingcaused by a neurologic problem.Herbal and homeopathic remediesSome herbal remedies, such as horsetail (Equisetumarvense) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. Atrained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti-tutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vitalforce, eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wet-ting. Common homeopathic remedies used in this treat-ment include Causticum, Lycopodium,and Pulsatilla.HypnosisHypnosis is another approach that is being used suc-cessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It trainsthe child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his orher bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less expensive, lesstime-consuming, and less dangerous than mostapproaches; it has virtually no side effects. Recent med-ical studies show that hypnotherapycan work quickly—within four to six sessions.
Prognosis
Occasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it doesnot have a “cure.” If the child has no underlying physicalor psychological problem that is causing the bed-wetting,in most cases he or she will outgrow the condition with-out treatment. About 15% of bedwetters become dry eachyear after age 6. If bed-wetting is frequent, accompaniedby daytime wetting, or falls into the American PsychiatricAssociation’s diagnostic definition of enuresis, a doctor
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 455Bed-wettingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 455should be consulted. If treatment is indicated, it usuallysuccessfully resolves the problem. Marked improvementis seen in about 75% of cases treated with wetness alarms.
Prevention
Although preventing a child from wetting the bed isnot always possible, parents can take steps to help thechild keep the bed dry at night. These steps include:• Encouraging and praising the child for staying dryinstead of punishing when the child wets.• Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, ifhe or she feels the need.• Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before bed-time.KEY TERMS

Bedsores
Definition
Bedsores are also called decubitus ulcers, pressureulcers, or pressure sores. These tender or inflamed patch-es develop when skin covering a weight-bearing part ofthe body is squeezed between bone and another bodypart, or a bed, chair, splint, or other hard object.
Description
Each year, about one million people in the UnitedStates develop bedsores ranging from mild inflammationto deep woundsthat involve muscle and bone. This oftenpainful condition usually starts with shiny red skin thatquickly blisters and deteriorates into open sores that canharbor life-threatening infection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 456BedsoresGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 456Bedsores are not cancerous or contagious. They aremost likely to occur in people who must use wheelchairsor who are confined to bed. In 1992, the federal Agencyfor Health Care Policy and Research reported that bed-sores afflict:• 10% of hospital patients• 25% of nursing home residents• 60% of quadriplegicsThe Agency also noted that 65% of elderly peoplehospitalized with broken hips develop bedsores and thatdoctors fees for treatment of bedsores amounted to$2,900 per person.Bedsores are most apt to develop on the:• ankles• back of the head• heels• hips• knees• lower back• shoulder blades• spinePeople over the age of 60 are more likely than youngerpeople to develop bedsores. Risk is also increased by:• atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries)• diabetes or other conditions that make skin more sus-ceptible to infection• diminished sensation or lack of feeling• heart problems• incontinence (inability to control bladder or bowelmovements)• malnutrition• obesity• paralysis or immobility• poor circulation• prolonged bed rest, especially in unsanitary conditionsor with wet or wrinkled sheets• spinal cord injury
Causes and symptoms
Bedsores most often develop when constant pressurepinches tiny blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutri-ents to the skin. When skin is deprived of oxygen andnutrients for as little as an hour, areas of tissue can dieand bedsores can form.Slight rubbing or friction against the skin can causeminor pressure ulcers. They can also develop when apatient stretches or bends blood vessels by slipping into adifferent position in a bed or chair.Urine, feces, or other moisture increases the risk ofskin infection, and people who are unable to move or rec-ognize internal cues to shift position have a greater thanaverage risk of developing bedsores.Other risk factors include:• malnutrition• anemia (lack of red blood cells)• diuse atrophy (muscle loss or weakness from lack ofuse)• infectionDiagnosis
Physical examination, medical history, and patientand caregiver observations are the basis of diagnosis.Special attention must be paid to physical or mentalproblems, like incontinence or confusion, that couldcomplicate a patient’s recovery.Bedsores usually follow six stages:• redness of skin• redness, swelling, and possible peeling of outer layer ofskin• dead skin, draining wound, and exposed layer of fat• tissue deaththrough skin and fat, to muscle• inner fat and muscle death• destruction of bone, bone, infection, fracture, and bloodinfection

Prompt medical attention can prevent surface pres-sure sores from deepening into more serious infections.For mild bedsores, treatment involves relieving pressure,keeping the wound clean and moist, and keeping the areaaround the ulcer clean and dry. Antiseptics, harsh soaps,and other skin cleansers can damage new tissue, so asaline solution should be used to cleanse the woundwhenever a fresh non-stick dressing is applied.The patient’s doctor may prescribe infection-fight-ing antibiotics, special dressings or drying agents, orlotions or ointments to be applied to the wound in a thinfilm three or four times a day. Warm whirlpool treat-ments are sometimes recommended for sores on the arm,hand, foot, or leg.In a procedure called debriding, a scalpel may beused to remove dead tissue or other debris from thewound. Deep, ulcerated sores that don’t respond to othertherapy may require skin grafts or plastic surgery.A doctor should be notified whenever a person:• will be bedridden or immobilized for an extended time• is very weak or unable to move• develops bedsoresImmediate medical attention is required whenever:• skin turns black or becomes inflamed, tender, swollen,or warm to the touch.• the patient develops a feverduring treatment.• the sore contains pus or has a foul-smelling discharge.With proper treatment, bedsores should begin to healtwo to four weeks after treatment begins.
Alternative treatment
Zinc and vitaminsA, C, E, and B complex help skinrepair injuries and stay healthy, but large doses of vita-mins or mineralsshould never be used without a doc-tor’s approval.A poultice made of equal parts of powdered slipperyelm (Ulmus fulva), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis), and echinacea(Echinaceaspp.) blended with a smallamount of hot water can relieve minor inflammation. Aninfection-fighting rinse can be made by diluting twodrops of essential tea tree oil (Melaleucaspp.) in eightounces of water. An herbal tea made from the calendula(Calendula officinalis) can act as an antiseptic andwound healing agent. Calendula cream can also be used.Contrasting hot and cold local applications canincrease circulation to the area and help flush out wasteproducts, speeding the healing process. The temperaturesshould be extreme (hot hot and ice cold), yet tolerable tothe skin. Hot compresses should be applied for threeminutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold compress appli-cation, repeating the cycle three times. The cycle shouldalways end with the cold compress.Prevention
It is usually possible to prevent bedsores from devel-oping or worsening. The patient should be inspected reg-ularly; should bathe or shower every day, using warmwater and mild soap; and should avoid cold or dry air. Abedridden patient should be repositioned at least onceevery two hours while awake. A person who uses awheelchair should shift his weight every 10 or 15 min-utes, or be helped to reposition himself at least once anhour. It is important to lift, rather than drag, a personbeing repositioned. Bony parts of the body should not bemassaged. Even slight friction can remove the top layerof skin and damage blood vessels beneath it.If the patient is bedridden, sensitive body parts canbe protected by:• sheepskin pads• special cushions placed on top of a mattress• a water-filled mattress• a variable-pressure mattress whose sections can beindividually inflated or deflated to redistribute pressurePillows or foam wedges can prevent a bedriddenpatient’s ankles from irritating each other, and pillowsplaced under the legs from mid-calf to ankle can raise theheels off the bed. Raising the head of the bed slightly andbriefly can provide relief, but raising the head of the bedmore than 30 degrees can cause the patient to slide,thereby causing damage to skin and tiny blood vessels.A person who uses a wheelchair should be encour-aged to sit up as straight as possible. Pillows behind thehead and between the legs can help prevent bedsores, ascan a special cushion placed on the chair seat. Donut-shaped cushions should not be used because they restrictblood flow and cause tissues to swell.
Prognosis
Bedsores can usually be cured, but about 60,000deaths a year are attributed to complications caused bybedsores. Bedsores can be slow to heal. Without propertreatment, they can lead to:• gangrene (tissue death)• osteomyelitis (infection of the bone beneath the bed-sore)• sepsis (tissue-destroying bacterial infection)

Behcet’s syndrome
Definition
A group of symptoms that affect a variety of body sys-tems, including musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and thecentral nervous system. These symptoms include ulcerationof the mouth or the genital area,skin lesions, and inflam-mation of the uvea (an area around the pupil of the eye).
Description
Behcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that involvesmultiple body systems. The disease is named for a Turk-ish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first reported apatient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers alongwith uveitisin 1937. The disease occurs worldwide, butis most prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and in theMediterranean region. There is a wider prevalenceamong males than females in a ratio of two to one.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown. Symp-toms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genitalarea, skin lesions, arthritis that affects mainly the kneesand ankles,painand irritation in the eyes, and fever. The mouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples andcan be quite painful. In the mouth, these ulcers are gener-ally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lipsor jaws. In the genital area, the ulcers usually occur onthe penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva ofwomen. The eye inflammation can lead to blindness.
Diagnosis
Because Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease,it is difficult to diagnose. International criteria have beenproposed to assist in classifying this disease. There is noone diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis dependson grouping together enough symptoms in order to identifythe disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur inother diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the otherdiseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached.
Treatment
Some of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s syn-drome include:• corticosteroids• cyclosporin• azathioprine• chlorambucil• interferon alpha• thalidomide• levamisole• pulse cyclophosphamide• cyclosporine
Prognosis
The prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generallypoor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s last-ing for 17 years. Although the disease is consideredpainful but not fatal, when the central nervous system isinvolved there is usually severe disability and death often occurs. The condition is usually chronic, althoughthere can be remissions during the course of the disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 459Behcet’s syndromeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 459There is no predictable method to determine whichpatients will progress into the more serious symptoms,and which might move into remission.
Prevention
There is no known prevention for Behcet’s syndrome.Resources

Bejel, also known as endemic syphilis, is a chronicbut curable disease, seen mostly in children in aridKEY TERMS
Remission—When active symptoms of a chronicdisease are absent.Uveitis—Inflammation of the area of the eyearound the pupil.regions. Unlike the better-known venereal syphilis,endemic syphilis is not a sexually transmitted disease.Description
Bejel has many other names depending on the locali-ty: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo aresome of the names. It is most commonly found in theMiddle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa, centralAsia, and Australia. Bejel is related to yawsand pinta, but has different symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes bejel,is very closely related to the one that causes the sexuallytransmitted form of syphilis, but transmission is very dif-ferent. In bejel, transmission is by direct contact, withbroken skin or contaminated hands, or indirectly by shar-ing drinking vessels and eating utensils. T. pallidumis passed on mostly between children living in poverty invery unsanitary environments and with poor hygiene.The skin, bones, and mucous membranes are affect-ed by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are common inthe mouth, throat, and nasal passages. Gummy lesionsmay form, even breaking through the palate. Other find-ings may include a region of swollen lymph nodes anddeep bone painin the legs. Eventually, bones maybecome deformed.
Diagnosis
T. pallidumcan be detected by microscopic study ofsamples taken from the sores or lymph fluid. However,since antibody tests don’t distinguish between the types ofsyphilis, specific diagnosis of the type of syphilis dependson the patient’s history, symptoms, and environment.
Treatment
Large doses of benzathine penicillin G given by injec-tion into the muscle can cure this disease in any stage,although it may take longer and require additional doses inlater stages. If penicillin cannot be given, the alternative istetracycline. Since tetracycline can permanently discolornew teeth still forming, it is usually not prescribed for chil-dren unless no viable alternative is available.
Prognosis
Bejel is completely curable with antibiotic treatment.
Prevention
The World Health Organization (WHO) has workedwith many countries to prevent this and other diseases, and

Wide-spread use of penicillin has been responsible for reducingthe number of existing cases, but the only way to eliminatebejel is by improving living and sanitation conditions.Resources

Bell’s palsy
Definition
Bell’s palsy describes an unexplained weakness orparalysisof the muscles on one side of the face. Afflict-ed individuals may be unable to close the eye on theaffected side of the face, and may also experience tear-ing, drooling, and hypersensitive hearing. The onset canbe quite sudden, sometimes occurring overnight.Although Bell’s palsy is unsettling and inconvenient, it istypically not indicative of a serious health problem. Theweakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majori-ty of cases.
Description
Bell’s palsy has been described as a diagnosis ofexclusion because several other disorders present similarKEY TERMS
Endemic disease—An infectious disease thatoccurs frequently in a specific geographicallocale. The disease often occurs in cycles. Influen-za is an example of an endemic disease.Lymph—This is a clear, colorless fluid found inlymph vessels and nodes. The lymph nodes con-tain organisms that destroy bacteria and other dis-ease causing organisms (also called pathogens).Syphilis—This disease occurs in two forms. One isa sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacte-ria. The second form is not sexually transmitted,but passed on by direct contact with the patient orthrough use of shared food dishes and utensils.symptoms. Facial palsies have been linked to conditionssuch as Lyme disease, ear infection,meningitis, syphilis, German measles(rubella),mumps,chicken- pox(varicella), and infection with Epstein-Barr virus(e.g.,infectious mononucleosis). True Bell’s palsy is anidiopathic facial palsy, meaning the root cause cannot beidentified. Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, itcan present symptoms similar to truly serious conditions,such as a stroke, ruptured aneurysm, or tumors.Every year, approximately 40,000-65,000 Americansare stricken with Bell’s palsy. Worldwide, there is anannual incidence of 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals.An individual can be affected at any age, but young andmiddle-aged adults are the most likely to be affected. It isunusual to see Bell’s palsy in people less than 10 yearsold. Bell’s palsy can affect either side of the face, and nei-ther gender seems to be at a greater risk. Pregnant womenand individuals with diabetes,influenza, a cold, or anupper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater risk.Although it cannot be considered a serious condition froma health standpoint, it can cause extreme stress, embar- rassment, and inconvenience for those affected.In the large majority of cases (80-85%), the facialweakness or paralysis is temporary. However, individualswho experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorerrecovery rate with only 60% returning to normal. Approx-imately 4-6% of all Bell’s palsy cases result in permanentfacial deformity, and another 10-15% experience perma-nent problems with spasms, twitching, or contracted mus-cles. Between 2% and 7.3% of individuals who haveexperienced Bell’s palsy will have a recurrence. On aver-age, the first recurrence happens 9.8 years after the firstepisode; the second, 6.7 years later. One recurrence isvery infrequent, and a second is extremely rare.
Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of Bell’s palsy arise from an inflam-mation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve, other-wise called the facial nerve. Both sides of the face have afacial nerve which controls the muscles on that side ofthe face. The course of the facial nerve passes through abony canal in the skull. When the nerve becomesswollen, it is compressed since the canal does not allowfor any expansion. As further swelling increases the com-pression, nerve signal conduction is impeded or evenprevented. The interference with the nerve signals is seenin the loss of muscle control and tone.Why the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bell’spalsy is a matter of some debate, and medical researchersand doctors are not in complete agreement. The best-sup-ported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virus(HSV), which is responsible for cold sores and fever
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 461Bell’s palsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 461blisters. HSV infection has been discovered in up to 70%of Bell’s palsy cases. Most people harbor this virus,although they may not exhibit symptoms.The major symptom of Bell’s palsy is one-sidedfacial weakness or paralysis. Muscle control is eitherinadequate or completely missing. There may also beinvoluntary facial movements, such as twitches, thataccompany certain facial expressions. Afflicted individu-als frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eyeand may not be able to close it at all.
Diagnosis
Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, itshares symptoms in common with serious conditions,such as stroke. Therefore, emergency medical attention isa wise and necessary precaution. Bell’s palsy affects thefacial nerve, unlike most strokes associated with facialweakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimatelysupplying the facial nerve. These two disorders can bedistinquished clinically because most strokes do notcause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles.The fact that Bell’s palsy is a diagnosis of exclusionbecomes apparent in the course of the medical examina-tion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out otherdisorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders thatneed to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g.,multiple sclerosis), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viralinfection, and bone fracture.During the physical examination, the afflicted indi-vidual is asked about recent illnesses, accidents, infec-tions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of theears, throat, and sinus is done, and hearing is tested. Theextent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym-metry of the face at rest and during voluntary move-ments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering thelips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move-ments are assessed in combination with the voluntarymovements. Neurologic examis done to rule outinvolvement of other parts of the nervous system exceptfor the facial muscles, which would exclude the diagno-sis of Bell’s palsy.In response to the individual’s medical history,blood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)analysisare ordered. The results of these tests helpdetermine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection oran inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests, inwhich a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated, may beused to assess the condition of facial muscles and thefacial nerve. Common tests include electromyography, which measures voluntary muscle movement, and nerveconduction velocity, which determines the extent ofnerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also beincluded, such as an x ray, as well as imaging tests, suchas magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computedtomography. These tests—especially MRI—allow anexcellent view of the nerve itself.Once all other possibilities are exhausted, a diagno-sis of Bell’s palsy is made. The following weeks are aperiod of watchful waiting. Further examinations aredone to track recovery. Results from nerve conductiontests may be used to predict an outcome. However, thisuse is questioned by some doctors and medicalresearchers since evidence for their predictive value isinconclusive.If facial movement, even a small amount, has notreturned within 3-4 months, the diagnosis of Bell’s palsymay need to be reevaluated.
Treatment
Many doctors prescribe an antiviral and/or a steroidfor Bell’s palsy, but there is some controversy aboutwhether these drugs actually help. The consensus opin-ion seems to be that, although drugs might not be neces-sary, they are not dangerous, and they may help in some

Reproduced bypermission.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 462cases, especially if there is complete paralysis. If drugsare used, they need to be taken as soon as possible fol-lowing the onset of symptoms. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, are prescribed todestroy actively replicating viruses and prevent furtherdamage to the facial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone,are thought to be useful in reducing swelling and, there-fore, compression on the nerve.In the past, surgery was performed to relieve thecompression on the nerve. However, this treatmentoption is now used very infrequently because it does notguarantee recovery, and it carries the risk of permanentnerve damage.The need to protect the affected eye is universallypromoted. Since the individual may not be able to lowerthe affected eyelid, the eye may become dry, particularlyat night. Excessive dryness can damage the cornea. Day-time treatment includes artificial tears and may includean eye patch or other protective measures. Nighttimetreatment involves a more intense effort at keeping theeye protected. Eye lubricants or viscous ointments, alongwith taping the eye shut, are frequently recommended.In cases of permanent nerve damage, cosmetic treat-ment options, such as therapeutic injections of botulism toxin or surgery, may be sought or suggested.
Alternative treatment
Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicinehave historically used acupunctureto treat Bell’s palsy. Thereare also some indications that facial massage and chiro- practicmanipulation may help treat the symptoms andimprove the outcome. There are also claims of therapeu-tic value for local injections or ingestion of vitamin B

supplements.
Prognosis
Most individuals with Bell’s palsy begin to noticeimprovement in their condition within 2-3 weeks of thesymptoms’ onset. At least 80% of them will be fully recov-ered within three months. Among the other 20% of afflict-ed individuals, symptoms may take longer to resolve orthey may be permanent. Individuals suffering permanentnerve damage may not regain control of the muscles onthe affected side of the face. These muscles may remainweak or paralyzed. If the nerve recovers imperfectly, theymay experience involuntary facial twitches or spasms thataccompany normal facial expressions.

Bence Jones protein test
Definition
Bence Jones proteins are small proteins (light chainsof immunoblobulin) found in the urine. Testing for theseproteins is done to diagnose and monitor multiple myelomaand other similar diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 463Bence Jones protein testGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 463Purpose
Bence Jones proteins are considered the first tumormarker. A tumor marker is a substance, made by thebody, that is linked to a certain cancer, or malignancy.Bence Jones proteins are made by plasma cells, a typeof white blood cell. The presence of these proteins in aperson’s urine is associated with a malignancy of plas-ma cells.Multiple myeloma, a tumor of plasma cells, is thedisease most often linked with Bence Jones proteins. Theamount of Bence Jones proteins in the urine indicateshow much tumor is present. Physicians use Bence Jonesproteins testing to diagnose the disease as well as tocheck how well the disease is responding to treatment.Other diseases involving cancerous or excessivegrowth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cellscan cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine. Thesediseases include: Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia,some lymphomas and leukemias, osteogenic sarcoma,cryoglobulinemia, malignant B-cell disease, amyloi- dosis, light chain disease, and cancer that has spreadto bone.
Description
Urine is the best specimen in which to look forBence Jones proteins. Proteins are usually too large tomove through a healthy kidney, from the blood into theurine. Bence Jones proteins are an exception. They aresmall enough to move quickly and easily through thekidney into the urine.A routine urinalysiswill not detect Bence Jonesproteins. There are several methods used by laboratoriesto detect and measure these proteins. The classic BenceJones reaction involves heating urine to 140°F (60°C). Atthis temperature, the Bence Jones proteins will clump.The clumping disappears if the urine is further heated toboiling and reappears when the urine is cooled. Otherclumping procedures using salts, acids, and other chemi-cals are also used to detect these proteins. These types ofKEY TERMS

Urine is usually collected throughout a 24-hour timeperiod. A person is given a large container in which tocollect the urine. The urine should be refrigerated until itis brought to the laboratory or physician’s office.
Normal results
Bence Jones proteins normally are not present in theurine.
Abnormal results
Bence Jones proteins are present in 50–80% of peo-ple with multiple myeloma. People with other malignan-cies also can have a positive Bence Jones proteins test,but less frequently.Certain nonmalignant diseases, such as rheumatoidarthritis,systemic lupus erythematosus, and chronicrenal insufficiency, can have Bence Jones proteins in theurine. High doses of penicillin or aspirinbefore collect-ing the urine can give a false positive result.Resources

Bender-Gestalt test
Definition
The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test (or Bender-Gestalt test) is a psychological assessment used to evalu-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 464Bender-Gestalt testGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 464ate visual-motor functioning, visual-perceptual skills,neurological impairment, and emotional disturbances inchildren and adults ages three and older.
Purpose
The Bender-Gestalt is used to evaluate visual-motor maturity and to screen children for developmen-tal delays. The test is also used to assess brain damageand neurological deficits. Individuals who have suf-fered a traumatic brain injury may be given the Bender-Gestalt as part of a battery of neuropsychological mea-sures, or tests.The Bender-Gestalt is sometimes used in conjunc-tion with other personality tests to determine the pres-ence of emotional and psychiatric disturbances such asschizophrenia.
Precautions
Psychometric testing requires a clinically trainedexaminer. The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test shouldbe administered and interpreted by a trained psychologistor psychiatrist. The Bender-Gestalt should always beemployed as only one element of a complete battery ofpsychological or developmental tests, and should neverbe used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.
Description
The original Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test wasdeveloped in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender. Thereare several different versions of the Bender-Gestalt avail-able today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test; Modified Ver-sion of the Bender-Gestalt test for Preschool and PrimarySchool Children; the Hutt Adaptation of the Bender-Gestalt test; the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test forChildren; the Bender-Gestalt test for Young Children; theWatkins Bender-Gestalt Scoring System; the CanterBackground Interference Procedure for the Bender-Gestalt test). All use the same basic test materials, butvary in their scoring and interpretation methods.The standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test con-sists of nine figures, each on its own 3 /H110035 card. Anexaminer presents each figure to the test subject one at atime and asks the subject to copy it onto a single piece ofblank paper. The only instruction given to the subject isthat he or she should make the best reproduction of thefigure possible. The test is not timed, although standardadministration time is typically 10-20 minutes. Aftertesting is complete, the results are scored based on accu-racy and organization. Interpretation depends on theform of the test in use. Common features considered inevaluating the drawings are rotation, distortion, symme-KEY TERMS

As an example, a patient withfrontal lobe injury may reproduce the same pattern overand over (perserveration)The Bender-Gestalt can also be administered in agroup setting. In group testing, the figures are shown totest subjects with a slide projector, in a test booklet, or onlarger versions of the individual test cards. Both the indi-vidual and group- administered Bender-Gestalt evaluationmay take place in either an outpatient or hospital setting.Patients should check with their insurance plans to deter-mine if these or other mental health services are covered.
Normal results
Children normally improve in this test as they age,but, because of the complexity of the scoring process,results for the Bender-Gestalt should only be interpretedby a clinically trained psychologist or psychiatrist.Resources

Benzodiazepines
Definition
Benzodiazepines are medicines that help relieve ner-vousness, tension, and other symptoms by slowing thecentral nervous system.
Purpose
Benzodiazepines are a type of antianxiety drugs. While anxietyis a normal response to stressful situa-tions, some people have unusually high levels of anxietythat can interfere with everyday life. For these people,benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under con-trol. The medicine can also relieve troubling symptomsof anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat, breathing prob-lems, irritability, nausea, and faintness.Physicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs forother conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy andother seizure disorders,phobias,panic disorder, with- drawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,this medicine should not be used every day for sleepproblems that last more than a few days. If used this way,the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.Benzodiazepines should not be used to relieve thenervousness and tension of normal everyday life.
Description
The family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi-azepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide(Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).These medicines take effect fairly quickly, starting to workwithin an hour after they are taken. Benzodiazepines areavailable only with a physician’s prescription and areavailable in tablet, capsule, liquid, or injectable forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofbenzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for whichit is being taken. Doses may be different for differentpeople. Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage.Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not takethe drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does notseem to be working, check with the physician who pre-scribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop taking themedicine unless the physician says to do so.Stopping thedrug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, espe-cially if it has been taken in large doses or over a longperiod. People who are taking the medicine for seizuredisorders may have seizures if they stop taking it sudden-ly. If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine, checkwith a physician for directions on how to stop. The physi-cian may recommend tapering down gradually to reducethe chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi-azepines is important, especially during the first fewmonths of treatment. The physician will check to makesure the medicine is working as it should and will noteunwanted side effects.People who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous-ness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder shouldcheck with their physicians every two to three months tomake sure they still need to keep taking the medicine.Patients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleepproblems should check with their physicians if they arenot sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems thatlast longer than this may be a sign of another medicalproblem.People who take this medicine to help them sleepmay have trouble sleeping when they stop taking themedicine. This effect should last only a few nights.Some people, especially older people, feel drowsy,dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using benzodi-azepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness orunsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at bedtime,these effects may even occur the next morning. Anyonewho takes these drugs should not drive, use machines ordo anything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 466BenzodiazepinesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 466Benzodiazepines may also cause behavior changesin some people, similar to those seen in people who actdifferently when they drink alcohol. More extremechanges, such as confusion, agitation, and hallucina-tions, also are possible. Anyone who starts havingstrange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking thismedicine should get in touch with his or her physician.Because benzodiazepines work on the central ner-vous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to theeffects of anesthetics, including those used for dental pro-cedures. These effects may last several days after treat-ment with benzodiazepines ends. The combined effects ofbenzodiazepines and alcohol or other CNS depressants(drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be verydangerous, leading to unconsciousness or, rarely, evendeath.Anyone taking benzodiazepines should not drinkalcohol and should check with his or her physician beforeusing any CNS depressants. Taking an overdose of benzo-diazepines can also cause unconsciousness and possiblydeath. Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or of theeffects of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol orother drugs should get immediate emergency help. Warn- ing signs include slurred speech or confusion, severedrowsiness, staggering, and profound weakness.Some benzodiazepines may change the results ofcertain medical tests. Before having medical tests, any-one taking this medicine should alert the health care pro-fessional in charge.Children are generally more sensitive than adults tothe effects of benzodiazepines. This sensitivity mayincrease the chance of side effects.Older people are more sensitive than younger adultsto the effects of this medicine and may be at greater riskfor side effects. Older people who take these drugs tohelp them sleep may be drowsy during the day. Olderpeople also increase their risk of falling and injuringthemselves when they take these drugs.Special conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake benzodiazepines. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions tobenzodiazepines or other mood-altering drugs in the pastshould let his or her physician know before taking thedrugs again. The physician should also be told about anyallergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.PREGNANCY. Some benzodiazepines increase thelikelihood of birth defects. Using these medicines duringpregnancymay also cause the baby to become dependenton them and to have withdrawal symptoms after birth.When taken late in pregnancy or around the time of laborand delivery, these drugs can cause other problems in thenewborn baby, such as weakness, breathing problems,slow heartbeat, and body temperature problems.Women who are pregnant or who may become preg-nant should not use benzodiazepines unless their anxietyis so severe that it threatens their pregnancy.Any womanwho must take this medicine while pregnant should besure to thoroughly discuss its risks and benefits with herphysician.
BREASTFEEDING. Benzodiazepines may pass intobreast milk and cause problems in babies whose motherstaken the medicine. These problems include drowsiness,breathing problems, and slow heartbeat. Women who arebreastfeeding their babies should not use this medicinewithout checking with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ben-zodiazepines, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:• current or past drug or alcohol abuse• depression• severe mental illness• epilepsy or other seizure disorders• swallowing problems• chronic lung disease such as emphysema,asthma,o r chronic bronchitis• kidney disease• liver disease• brain disease•glaucoma• hyperactivity• myasthenia gravis• porphyria• sleep apnea
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking benzodiaze-pines with certain other drugs may affect the way thedrugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, light- headedness, drowsiness, clumsiness, unsteadiness, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 467BenzodiazepinesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 467slurred speech. These problems usually go away as thebody adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treat-ment unless they persist or they interfere with normalactivities.More serious side effects are not common, but mayoccur. If any of the following side effects occur, checkwith the physician who prescribed the medicine as soonas possible:• behavior changes• memory problems• difficulty concentrating• confusion• depression• seizures (convulsions)• hallucinations• sleep problems• increased nervousness, excitability, or irritability• involuntary movements of the body, including the eyes•lLow blood pressureKEY TERMS

Beriberi
Definition
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thi-amine (vitamin B
1) that affects many systems of thebody, including the muscles, heart, nerves, and digestivesystem. Beriberi literally means “I can’t, I can’t” in Sing-halese, which reflects the crippling effect it has on itsvictims. It is common in parts of southeast Asia, wherewhite rice is the main food. In the United States, beriberiis primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism.
Description
Beriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav-aged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it wascaused by something in food. Not until the early 1900sdid scientists discover that rice bran, the outer coveringthat was removed to create the polished white rice pre-ferred by Asians, actually contained something that pre-vented the disease. Thiamine was the first vitamin identi-fied. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were usedto treat the disease.In adults, there are different forms of beriberi, classi-fied according to the body systems most affected. Dryberiberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi affectsthe heart and circulation. Both types usually occur in thesame patient, with one set of symptoms predominating.A less common form of cardiovascular, or wetberiberi, is known as “shoshin.” This condition involves arapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure. It is highly fatal and is known to cause sudden deathin young migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists ofwhite rice.Cerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-Korsakoffsyndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affectsthe central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It canbe caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiaminedeficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting.Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi-amine-deficient mothers, who live in developing nations.Although severe beriberi is uncommon in the UnitedStates, less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur. About25% of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the UnitedStates show some evidence of thiamine deficiency.
Causes and symptoms
Thiamine is one of the B vitaminsand plays animportant role in energy metabolism and tissue building.It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi- amine pyrophosphate (TPP),which is essential in reac-tions that produce energy from glucose or that convertglucose to fat for storage in the tissues. When there is notenough thiamine in the diet, these basic energy functionsare disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body.Special situations, such as an over-active metabo-lism, prolonged fever,pregnancy, and breastfeeding,can increase the body’s thiamine requirements and leadto symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diar- rheaor chronic liver disease can result in the body’sinability to maintain normal levels of many nutrients,including thiamine. Other persons at risk are patientswith kidney failure on dialysis and those with severedigestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrients.Alcoholics are susceptible because they may substitutealcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcoholdecreases the body’s ability to absorb thiamine.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 469BeriberiGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 469The following systems are most affected by beriberi:• Gastrointestinal system. When the cells of the smoothmuscles in the digestive system and glands do not getenough energy from glucose, they are unable to pro-duce more glucose from the normal digestion of food.There is a loss of appetite,indigestion, severe consti- pation, and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.• Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the centralnervous system to function normally. Early deficiencysymptoms are fatigue, irritability, and poor memory. Ifthe deficiency continues, there is damage to the periph-eral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscleweakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The legs are most affected. The toes feel numb and the feethave a burning sensation; the leg muscles become soreand the calf muscles cramp. The individual walksunsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squattingposition. Eventually, the muscles shrink (atrophy) andthere is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet; the feetmay hang limp (footdrop).• Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat andsweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.Because the smooth muscle in the blood vessels isaffected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling,known as edema, in the legs.• Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread musclepaincaused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue.Infants who are breastfed by a thiamine-deficient motherusually develop symptoms of deficiency between thesecond and fourth month of life. They are pale, restless,unable to sleep, prone to diarrhea, and have musclewasting and edema in their arms and legs. They have acharacteristic, sometimes silent, cry and develop heartfailure and nerve damage.
Diagnosis
A physical examinationwill reveal many of theearly symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation,nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but the deficien-cy may be difficult to identify. Information about theindividual’s diet and general health is also needed.There are many biochemical tests based on thiaminemetabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thi-amine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can be measured inthe blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a defi-ciency. The urine can be collected for 24 hours to mea-sure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable testmeasures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activitysince all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of redblood cells.An electroencephalogram (EEG), which measureselectrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule outother causes of neurologic changes. Observing improve-ments in the patient after giving thiamine supplementswill also confirm the diagnosis.Treatment
Treatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency inthe body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe thi-amine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiaminegiven by injection into a muscle (intramuscular) or in asolution that goes into a vein (intravenously) for severaldays. Then smaller doses can be given either by injectionor in pill form until the patient recovers. Usually thereare other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will alsoneed treatment.The cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi canrespond to treatment within a few hours if they are nottoo severe. Heart failure may require additional treatmentwith diureticsthat help eliminate excess fluid and withheart-strengthening drugs like digitalis.Recovery from peripheral neuropathy and othersymptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patientsfrequently become discouraged. They should stay active;physical therapy will also help in recovery.Infantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine toboth the infant and the breast feeding mother until levelsare normal.In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine shouldbe given intravenously or by injection at first because theintestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impairedand the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will berelieved by treatment, though there may be residualmemory loss.Excess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine,and negative reactions to too much thiamine are rare.Thiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it should notbe taken with antacidsor barbiturates.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for beriberi deal first withcorrecting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventionaltreatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stressa diet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vita-mins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw fruits andvegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt. Drinkingmore than one glass of liquid with a meal should beavoided, since this may wash out the vitamins beforethey can be absorbed by the body. Thiamine should betaken daily, with the dose depending on the severity of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 470BeriberiGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 470the disease. Additional supplements of B vitamins, amultivitamin and mineral complex, and Vitamin C arealso recommended. Other alternative therapies may helprelieve the person’s symptoms after the thiamine defi-ciency is corrected.
Prognosis
Beriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the defi-ciency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most of thesymptoms can be reversed and full recovery is possiblewhen thiamine levels are returned to normal and main-tained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements asneeded.
Prevention
A balanced diet containing all essential nutrientswill prevent a thiamine deficiency and the developmentof beriberi. People who consume large quantities of junkfood like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high carbohy-drate foods made with unenriched flours may be defi-cient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They mayneed to take vitamin supplements and should improvetheir diets.Dietary RequirementsThe body’s requirements for thiamine are tied to car-bohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms of totalintake of calories. The current recommended dietaryallowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for every 1,000 calories,with a minimum daily intake of 1 mg even for those whoeat fewer than 2,000 calories in a day. The RDA for chil-dren and teenagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg dailyfor males over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females. Dur-ing pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is needed.Because of increased energy needs and the secretion ofthiamine in breast milk, breast feeding mothers need 1.5mg every day. In infants, 0.4 mg is advised.Food SourcesThe best food sources of thiamine are lean pork,beef, liver, brewer’s yeast, peas and beans, whole orenriched grains, and breads. The more refined the food,as in white rice, white breads, and some cereals, thelower the thiamine. Many food products are enrichedwith thiamine, along with riboflavin, niacin, and iron, toprevent dietary deficiency.During the milling process, rice is polished and all thevitamins in the exterior coating of bran are lost. Boiling therice before husking preserves the vitamins by distributingthem throughout the kernel. Food enrichment programshave eliminated beriberi in Japan and the PhillipinesKEY TERMS

Definition
Berylliosis is lung inflammation caused by inhalingdust or fumes that contain the metallic element beryllium.Found in rocks, coal, soil, and volcanic dust, beryllium isused in the aerospace industry and in many types of man-ufacturing. Berylliosis occurs in both acute and chronicforms. In some cases, appearance of the disease may bedelayed as much as 20 years after exposure to beryllium.
Description
In the 1930s, scientists discovered that berylliumcould make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During thefollowing decade, the hard, grayish metal was identifiedas the cause of a potentially debilitating, sometimesdeadly disease characterized by shortness of breathand inflammation, swelling, and scarring of the lungs.The manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is nolonger a source of beryllium exposure, but serious healthhazards are associated with any work environment orprocess in which beryllium fumes or particles becomeairborne. Working with pure beryllium, beryllium com-pounds (e.g. beryllium oxide), or beryllium alloys causesoccupational exposure. So do jobs involving:• electronics• fiber optics• manufacturing ceramics, bicycle frames, golf clubs,mirrors, and microwave ovens• mining• nuclear weapons and reactors• reclaiming scrap metal• space and atomic engineering.• dental and laboratory technologyBeryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic airpollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA). It is estimated that 2–6% of workers exposed tothese contaminants eventually develop berylliosis.
Causes and symptoms
Coughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss thatbegin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. Thiscondition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflamesthe lungs making them rigid; it can affect the eyes and skinas well. People who have acute berylliosis are usually veryill. Most recover, but some die of the disease.Chronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to long-term exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust orfumes. A systemic disease that causes formation ofabnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymphnodes, chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts ofthe body. The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are large-ly the same as those seen in acute berylliosis, but theydevelop more slowly.
Diagnosis
Berylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp-toms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure. Achest x rayshows characteristic changes in the lungs.However, since these changes can resemble those causedby other lung diseases, further testing may be necessary.The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT),a blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. anallergic reaction to beryllium), is used to screen individualsat risk of developing berylliosis. When screening resultsreveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed oncells washed from the lungs. This test is now consideredthe most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis.
Treatment
Individuals with beryllium sensitivity or early-stageberylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involveberyllium exposure and regularly examined to determinewhether the disease has progressed.Acute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion-ally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with acuteberylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy isrequired to lessen lung inflammation.Chronic beryllium disease is incurable. Corticos-teroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is not certain thatsteroids can alter the progression of the disease, and theyhave no effect on scarring of lung tissue. Cleansing thelungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term thera-py may be required. Chelation therapyis currentlyunder investigation as a treatment for the disease.
Prognosis
Most patients with acute berylliosis recover fully7–10 days after treatment begins, and the disease usuallycauses no after effects.Patients whose lungs are severely damaged bychronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failurebecause of the strain placed on the heart.
Prevention
Eliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest wayto prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who areexposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop anallergic reaction to these substances is an effective wayto control symptoms and prevent disease progression.

Purpose
Beta2-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface ofwhite blood cells. Increased production or destruction ofthese cells causes Beta
2-microglobulin levels in the bloodto increase. This increase is seen in people with cancersinvolving white blood cells, but it is particularly mean-ingful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myelo-ma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy (cancer) of a cer-tain kind of white blood cell, called a plasma cell. At thetime of diagnosis, the Beta

2-microglobulin normally is filtered out of theblood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round mass of capil-lary loops leading to each kidney tubule), only to be par-tially reabsorbed back into the blood when it reaches thekidney’s tubules. In glomerular kidney disease, theglomeruli can’t filter it out of the blood, so levelsincrease in the blood and decrease in the urine. In tubularkidney disease, the tubules can’t reabsorb it back into theblood, so urine levels rise and blood levels fall. After akidney transplant, increased blood levels may be an earlysign of rejection.Increased urinary levels are found in people withkidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavymetals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of work-ers exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kid-ney damage.Beta
2-microglobulin levels also rise during infec-tion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus andhuman immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV). Studies showthat as HIV disease advances, beta
2-microglobulin lev-els rise.
Description
Testing methods vary, but most involve adding theperson’s serum—the yellow, liquid part of blood—orurine to one or more substances that bind to beta
2- microglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of thesubstance(s) bound to beta
2-microglobulin is measuredand the original amount of beta
2-microglobulin isdetermined.The test is covered by insurance when medicallynecessary. Results are usually available the next day.

The blood test requires 5 mL of blood. A healthcareworker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper arm,locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts aneedle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.Urine may be a single collection or collectedthroughout a 24-hour time period. The urine should berefrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory and mustnot become acidic.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs on the puncture site relieve discomfort.
Normal results

Beta blockers
Definition
Beta blockers are medicines that affect the body’sresponse to certain nerve impulses. This, in turn, decreasesthe force and rate of the heart’s contractions, which lowersblood pressure and reduces the heart’s demand for oxygen.
Purpose
The main use of beta blockers is to treat high bloodpressure. Some also are used to relieve the type of chestpaincalled anginaor to prevent heart attacks in peoplewho already have had one heart attack. These drugsmay also be prescribed for other conditions, such asmigraine,tremors, and irregular heartbeat. In eye dropform, they are used to treat certain kinds of glaucoma.
Description
Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic block-ers, are available only with a physician’s prescription.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 474Beta blockersGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 474The come in capsule, tablet, liquid, and injectable forms.Some common beta blockers are atenolol (Tenormin),metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), propranolol(Inderal), and timolol (Blocadren). Timolol and certainother beta blockers are also sold in eye drop form fortreating glaucoma. Eye drops that contain beta blockersinclude betaxolol (Betoptic), cartelol (Ocupress), andtimolol (Timoptic).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type,strength, and form of beta blocker and the condition forwhich it is prescribed. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.This medicine may take several weeks to noticeablylower blood pressure. Taking it exactly as directed isimportant.Do not stop taking this medicine without checkingwith the physician who prescribed it. Some conditionsmay get worse when patients stop taking beta blockersabruptly. This may also increase the risk of heart attackin some people. Because of these possible effects, it isimportant to keep enough medicine on hand to getthrough weekends, holidays, and vacations.Physicians may recommend that patients check theirpulse before and after taking this medicine. If the pulsebecomes too slow, circulation problems may result.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking betablockers is important. The physician will check to makesure the medicine is working as it should and will watchfor unwanted side effects. People who have high bloodpressure often feel perfectly fine. However, they shouldcontinue to see their physicians even when they feel wellso that the physician can keep a close watch on their con-dition. Patients also need to keep taking their medicineeven when they feel fine.Beta blockers will not cure high blood pressure, butwill help control the condition. To avoid the serioushealth problems that high blood pressure can cause,patients may have to take medicine for the rest of theirlives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoidcertain foods and keep their weight under control. Thehealth care professional who is treating the condition canoffer advice on what measures may be necessary.Patients being treated for high blood pressure should notchange their dietswithout consulting their physicians.Anyone taking beta blockers for high blood pressureshould not take any other prescription or over-the-counter medicine without first checking with his or herphysician. Some medicines may increase blood pressure.Anyone who is taking beta blockers should be sureto tell the health care professional in charge before hav-ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-gency treatment.Some beta blockers may change the results of cer-tain medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyonetaking this medicine should alert the health care profes-sional in charge.Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheadedwhen taking beta blockers. Anyone who takes thesedrugs should not drive, use machines or do anything elsethat might be dangerous until they have found out howthe drugs affect them.Beta blockers may increase sensitivity to cold, espe-cially in older people or people who have poor circula-tion. Anyone who takes this medicine should dresswarmly in cold weather and should be careful not to beexposed to the cold for too long.People who usually have chest pain when they exer- ciseor exert themselves may not have the pain when theyare taking beta blockers. This could lead them to be moreactive than they should be. Anyone taking this medicineshould ask his or her physician how much exercise andactivity is safe.Older people may be unusually sensitive to theeffects of beta blockers. This may increase the chance ofside effects.Physicians may advise people taking beta blockersto wear or carry medical identification indicating thatthey are taking this medicine.Special conditionsPeople who have certain medical conditions or whoare taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take beta blockers. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto beta blockers in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergiesto insect stings,medicines, foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-stances. In people with allergies to medicines, foods, orinsect stings, beta blockers may make the allergic reac-tions more severe and harder to treat. Anyone who has anallergic reaction while taking beta blockers should getmedical attention right away and should make sure the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 475Beta blockersGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 475physician in charge knows that he or she is taking thismedicine.Beta blockers may also cause serious reactions inpeople who take allergy shots. Anyone taking this medi-cine should be sure to alert the physician before havingany allergy shots.
DIABETES. Beta blockers may make blood sugar lev-els rise and may hide some symptoms of low bloodsugar. Diabetic patients should discuss these possibleproblems with their physicians.
PREGNANCY. Some studies of beta blockers showthat these drugs cause problems in newborns whosemothers use them during pregnancy. Other studies donot show such effects. Women who are pregnant or whomay become pregnant should check with their physiciansabout the use of beta blockers.
BREASTFEEDING. Some beta blockers pass intobreast milk and may cause breathing problems, slowheartbeat, and low blood pressure in nursing babieswhose mothers take the drugs. Women who need to takebeta blockers and who want to breastfeed their babiesshould check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Beta blockers mayincrease breathing problems or make allergic reactionsmore severe in people who have allergies,bronchitis,o r emphysema.In people with an overactive thyroid, stopping betablockers suddenly may cause an increase in symptoms.Also, taking this medicine may hide a fast heartbeat,which is one of the symptoms of overactive thyroid.Effects of these drugs may be greater in people withkidney or liver disease because the medicine is clearedfrom the body more slowly.Beta blockers may also make the following medicalconditions worse:• Heart or blood vessel disease• Unusually slow heartbeat (bradycardia)• Myasthenia gravis (chronic disease causing muscleweakness and possibly paralysis)• Psoriasis (itchy, scaly, red patches of skin)• Depression (now, or in the past).Before using beta blockers, people with any of themedical problems listed in this section should make suretheir physicians are aware of their conditions.USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking beta blockerswith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, sleep problems, unusualtiredness or weakness, and decreased sexual ability. Inmen, this can occur as impotenceor delayed ejaculation.These problems usually go away as the body adjusts tothe drug and do not require medical treatment unless theypersist or they interfere with normal activities.More serious side effects are possible. If any of thefollowing side effects occur, check with the physicianwho prescribed the medicine as soon as possible:• Breathing problems• Slow heartbeat• Cold hands and feet• Swollen ankles, feet, or lower legs.• Mental depression.Other side effects may occur. Anyone who hasunusual symptoms after taking beta blockers should getin touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Beta blockers may interact with a number of othermedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Anyone who takes beta blockers should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with beta blockers are:

Definition
Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, is a malig-nant tumor of the bile ducts within the liver (intrahepatic),or leading from the liver to the small intestine (extrahepat-ic). It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients.
Description
Bile is a substance manufactured by the liver thataids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels thatcarry the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Likethe tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in the liverconverge into two large bile ducts called the left and righthepatic ducts. These exit the liver and join to form thecommon hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concen-trates and stores the bile, empties into the commonhepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Finally, thislarge duct connects to the small intestine where the bilecan help digest food. Collectively, this network of bileducts is called the biliary tract.Bile duct cancer originates from the cells that linethe inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may ariseanywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outsideof the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-growingtumors that spread by local invasion of neighboringstructures and by way of lymphatic channels.Bile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In theUnited States, approximately one case arises per 100,000people per year, but it is more common in SoutheastAsia. It occurs in men only slightly more often than inwomen, and it is most commonly diagnosed in people intheir 50s and 60s.
Causes and symptoms
A number of risk factors are associated with thedevelopment of bile duct cancer:• Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This disease is charac-terized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract, some-times associated with inflammatory bowel disease.• Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations ofthe biliary tract that usually form during fetal develop-ment. There is evidence that these cysts may rarelyarise during adulthood.• Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone formationwithin the liver (not including gallbladder stones).• Liver flukes. Parasitic infection with certain worms isthought to be at least partially responsible for the higherprevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast Asia.

Exposure to Thorotrast has beenimplicated in the development of cancer of the liver aswell as the bile ducts.SymptomsJaundiceis the first symptom in 90% of patients.This occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an obstruc-tion in the normal flow of bile from the liver to the smallintestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile, builds up withinthe liver and is absorbed into the bloodstream in excessamounts. This can be detected in a blood test, but it canalso manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin andeyes. The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes theurine appear dark. Additionally, the patient may experi-ence generalized itchingdue to the deposition of bilecomponents in the skin. Normally, a portion of the bile isexcreted in stool; bile actually gives stool its browncolor.

Sometimes the biliary tract can becomeinfected, but this is normally a rare consequence of inva-sive tests. Infection causes fever, chills, and pain in theright upper portion of the abdomen.
Diagnosis
Certain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in thediagnosis. The most important one is the test for elevatedbilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of alkalinephosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be elevated.When symptoms, physical signs, and blood testspoinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, thenthe next step involves radiographic tests. Ultrasound andcomputed tomography (CT scan) are noninvasive andrapid. These tests can often detect the actual tumor aswell as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract. If thesetests indicate the presence of a tumor, then cholangiogra-phy is required. This procedure involves injecting dyeinto the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bileducts and the tumor. The specialist that performs this testcan also insert small tubes, or stents, into a partiallyobstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent furtherobstruction by growth of the tumor. This is vitally impor-tant since it may be the only intervention that is possiblein certain patients. Cholangiography is an invasive testthat carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tract.The objective of these radiological tests is to determinethe size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent ofspread to nearby structures.The treatment of bile duct tumors is usually notaffected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprisethe tumor. For this reason, some physicians forego biop-sy of the tumor.
Treatment
The treatment is with surgical resection (removal) ofthe tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,sometimes the cancer has already spread too far when thediagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile duct can-cer, the first question to answer is if the tumor may besafely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to thepatient. If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or hasspread widely throughout the liver, then resection may notbe possible. Sometimes further invasive testing is required.Angiographycan determine if the blood vessels areinvolved. Laparoscopyis a surgical procedure that allowsthe surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymphnodes without making a large incision in the abdomen. Onlyabout 45% of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 478Bile duct cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 478If the tumor is resectable, and the patient is healthyenough to tolerate the operation, then the specific type ofsurgery performed depends on the location of the tumor.For tumors within the liver or high up in the biliary tract,resection of part of the liver may be required. Tumors inthe middle portion of the biliary tract can be removedalone. Tumors of the lower end of the biliary tract mayrequire extensive resection of part of the pancreas, smallintestine, and stomach to ensure complete resection.Unfortunately, sometimes the cancer appearsresectable by all the radiological and invasive tests, but isfound to be unresectable during surgery. In this scenario, abypass operation can relieve the biliary tract obstruction,but does not remove the tumor itself. This does not producea cure but it can offer a better quality of life for the patient.Chemotherapyand radiation therapyhave not been proven effective in the treatment of bile duct cancer.PrognosisPrognosis depends on the stage and resectability ofthe tumor. If the patient cannot undergo surgical resec-tion, then the survival rate is commonly less than oneyear. If the tumor is resected, the survival rate improves,with 20% of these patients surviving past five years.Clinical trialsStudies of new treatments in patients are known asclinical trials. These trials seek to compare the standardmethod of care with a new method, or the trials may be try-ing to establish whether one treatment is more beneficialfor certain patients than others. Sometimes, a new treat-ment that is not being offered on a wide scale may be avail-able to patients participating in clinical trials, but participat-ing in the trials may involve some risk. To learn more aboutclinical trials, patients can call the National Cancer Institute(NCI) at 1-800-4-CANCER or visit the NCI web site forpatients at <http://www.cancertrials.nci.nih.gov>.

Other than the avoidance of infections caused by liverflukes, there are no known preventions for this cancer.Resources

Biliary atresia
Definition
Biliary atresia is the failure of a fetus to develop anadequate pathway for bile to drain from the liver to theintestine.
Description
Biliary atresia is the most common lethal liver diseasein children, occurring once every 10,000–15,000 livebirths. Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason.The normal anatomy of the bile system begins with-in the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts collectbile from liver cells. These ducts merge into larger andlarger channels, like streams flowing into rivers, untilthey all pour into a single duct that empties into the duo-denum (first part of the small intestine). Between theliver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel con-nected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores bileand concentrates it, removing much of its water content.Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the gall bladdercontracts and empties its contents.Bile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liverremoves from the circulation and excretes through thebiliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bileassists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile cannotget out because the channels are absent or blocked, itbacks up into the liver and eventually into the rest of thebody. The major pigment in bile is a chemical calledbilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a breakdown prod-uct of hemoglobin (the red chemical in blood that carriesoxygen). If the body accumulates an excess of bilirubin,

Duodenum—The first part of the small intestine,beginning at the outlet of the stomach.Hemoglobin—The red, iron-containing chemicalin the blood that carries oxygen to the tissues.Jaundice—The yellow color taken on by a patientwhose liver is unable to excrete bilirubin. A normalcondition in the first week of life due to the infant’sdelayed ability to process certain waste products.Kernicterus—A potentially lethal disease of new-borns caused by excessive accumulation of thebile pigment bilirubin.
it turns yellow (jaundiced). Bile also turns the stoolbrown. Without it, stools are the color of clay.
Causes and symptoms
It is possible that a viral infection is responsible forthis disease, but evidence is not yet convincing. Thecause remains unknown.The affected infant will appear normal at birth andduring the newborn period. After two weeks the normaljaundiceof the newborn will not disappear, and thestools will probably be clay-colored. At this point, thecondition will come to the attention of a physician. If not,the child’s abdomen will begin to swell, and the infantwill get progressively more ill. Nearly all untreated chil-dren will die of liver failure within two years.
Diagnosis
The persistence of jaundice beyond the second weekin a newborn with clay-colored stools is a sure sign ofobstruction to the flow of bile. An immediate evaluationthat includes blood tests and imaging of the biliary sys-tem will confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment. Somehow the surgeonmust create an adequate pathway for bile to escape theliver into the intestine. The altered anatomy of the biliarysystem is different in every case, calling upon the sur-geon’s skill and experience to select and execute the mosteffective among several options. If the obstruction is onlybetween the gall bladder and the intestine, it is possible toattach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder. Morelikely, the upper biliary system will also be inadequate,and the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly tothe liver—the Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the bodywill discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liverare discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bilewill begin to flow in that direction, and the channels willgradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai procedureare commonly 50% at five years and 15% at 10 years. Per-sistent disease in the liver gradually destroys the organ.Liver transplantationmust be anticipated in all butthe few patients who continue to do well after a Kasaiprocedure. Accumulating experience and newer tech-niques of liver transplantation are producing very gratify-ing early results.Prognosis
Before liver transplants became available, evenprompt and effective surgery did not cure the wholeproblem. Biliary drainage can usually be established, butthe patients still have a defective biliary system thatdevelops progressive disease and commonly leads to anearly death. Transplantation now achieves up to 90%one-year survival rates and promises to prevent thechronic disease that used to accompany earlier proce-dures.
Prevention
The specific cause of this birth defect is unknown, soall that women can do is to practice the many generalpreventive measures, even before they conceive.

Binge-eating disorder
Definition
Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by aloss of control over eating behaviors. The binge eaterconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a shorttime period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularlyengage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors(for example, excessive exercise, vomiting, taking laxa- tives) following the binge episodes.
Description
BED typically strikes individuals sometime betweenadolescence and the early twenties. Because of the natureof the disorder, most BED patients are overweight orobese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown thatan average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these pro-grams report binge eating behavior.
Causes and symptoms
Binge eating episodes may act as a psychologicalrelease for excessive emotional stress. Other circum-stances that may predispose an individual to BED includeheredity and affective disorders, such as major depression.BED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid, orco-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam-ple, compulsive buying),post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD),panic disorder, or personality disorders.Individuals who develop BED often come from fam-ilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance offood, for example, as a source of comfort in times ofemotional distress. As children, BED patients may havebeen taught to clean their plate regardless of theirappetite, or that finishing a meal made them a “good”girl or boy. Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thin-ness may also be a factor in the BED equation.During binge episodes, BED patients experience adefinite sense of lost control over their eating. They eatquickly and to the point of discomfort even if they aren’thungry. They typically binge alone two or more times aweek, and often feel depressed and guilty once theepisode has concluded.
Diagnosis
Binge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treatedby a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to aninterview with the patient, personality and behavioralinventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person-ality Inventory(MMPI), may be administered as part ofthe assessment process. One of several clinical inventories,or scales, may also be used to assess depressive symptoms,including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) orBeck Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may beadministered in an outpatient or hospital setting.
Treatment
Many BED individuals binge after long intervals ofexcessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize thispattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach thepatient to gain control over his eating behavior by focus-ing on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog- nitive-behavioral therapy,group therapy, or interper-sonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover theemotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioralpatterns behind the binge eating.Because the prevalence of depression in BEDpatients is high, psychopharmacological treatment withantidepressants may also be prescribed. Once the bingeeating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms arecontrolled, the physical symptoms of BED can beaddressed. The overweight BED patient may be placedon a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may beconsulted to educate the patient on healthy food choicesand strategies for weight loss.
Prognosis
The poor dietary habits and obesitythat are sympto-matic of BED can lead to serious health problems, such ashigh blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left

BED is a chronic condition that requires ongo-ing medical and psychological management. To bringlong-term relief to the BED patient, it is critical to addressthe underlying psychological causes behind binge eatingbehaviors. It appears that up to 50% of BED patients willstop bingeing with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Resources

Definition
Biofeedback, or applied psychophysiological feed-back, is a patient-guided treatment that teaches an indi-vidual to control muscle tension,pain, body temperature,brain waves, and other bodily functions and processesthrough relaxation, visualization, and other cognitive con-trol techniques. The name biofeedback refers to the bio-logical signals that are fed back, or returned, to the patientin order for the patient to develop techniques of manipu-lating them.
Purpose
Biofeedback has been used to successfully treat anumber of disorders and their symptoms, including tem- poromandibular joint disorder(TMJ), chronic pain,irritable bowel syndrome(IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome,epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), migraine headaches,anxiety, depression, trau-matic brain injury, and sleep disorders.Illnesses that may be triggered at least in part bystressare also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certaintypes of headaches, high blood pressure,bruxism(teeth grinding),post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disor-ders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disordersmay be treated successfully by teaching patients the ability torelax and release both muscle and mental tension.Biofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensivetreatment program for some of these disorders.NASA has used biofeedback techniques to treatastronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, duringwhich the autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scien-tists at the University of Tennessee have adapted thesetechniques to treat individuals suffering from severenausea and vomitingthat is also rooted in autonomicnervous system dysfunction.Recent research also indicates that biofeedback maybe a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti-nenceregain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-floor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better con-trol over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors areplaced on the muscles to train the patient where they areand when proper contractions are taking place.
Description
OriginsIn 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist,suggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 482BiofeedbackGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 482instance, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinalactivity, regional blood flow) could be under voluntarycontrol. As a result of his experiments, he showed thatsuch autonomic processes were controllable. This workled to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s workwas expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, researchperformed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. BarrySterman established that both cats and monkeys could betrained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman thenused his research techniques on human patients withepilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the1970s, other researchers published reports of their use ofbiofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomachacid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since theearly work of Miller and Sterman, biofeedback hasdeveloped into a front-line behavioral treatment for aneven wider range of disorders and symptoms.During biofeedback, special sensors are placed onthe body. These sensors measure the bodily function thatis causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heartrate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec-tromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-troencophalographic feedback), respiration, and bodytemperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor-mation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as apaper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.While the patient views the instantaneous feedbackfrom the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog-nize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence hisor her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationshipbetween mind and body, the patient can then use thesesame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as theseact as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-ious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,brain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodilyfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.As the biofeedback response takes place, patientscan actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant-ly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip-ment. Once these techniques are learned and the patientis able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualiza-tion necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeedbackequipment itself is no longer needed. The patient thenhas a powerful, portable, and self-administered treatmenttool to deal with problem symptoms.Biofeedback that specializes in reading and alteringbrain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback. The brain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta,theta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre-quency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brainwave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, whichoccur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35Hz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averagesfall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-arousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be presentin conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-order, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxietydisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessivestress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizingthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-es on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) andtheta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated withdeep, meditative states, and has been used with somesuccess in substance abuse treatment.Through brain wave manipulation, neurofeedbackcan be useful in treating a variety of disorders that aresuspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, suchas epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraineheadaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,and sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeed-back usually uses a monitor as an output device. Themonitor displays specific patterns that the patientattempts to change by producing the appropriate type ofbrain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient forproducing the appropriate brain wave by producing apositive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children maybe rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis-played video game.

Therapists usually recommend thattheir patients practice both biofeedback and relaxationtechniques on their own at home.
Preparations
Before initiating biofeedback treatment, the thera-pist and patient will have an initial consultation to recordthe patients medical history and treatment backgroundand discuss goals for therapy.Before a neurofeedback session, an EEG is takenfrom the patient to determine his or her baseline brain-wave pattern.Biofeedback typically is performed in a quiet andrelaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for thepatient. Depending on the type and goals of biofeedbackbeing performed, one or more sensors will be attached tothe patient’s body with conductive gel and/or adhesives.These may include:• Electromyographic (EMG) sensors. EMG sen-sors measure electrical activity in the muscles, specifical-ly muscle tension. In treating TMJ or bruxism, these sen-sors would be placed along the muscles of the jaw.Chronic pain might be treated by monitoring electricalenergy in other muscle groups.• Galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors. These are elec-trodes placed on the fingers that monitor perspiration,or sweat gland, activity. These may also be called skinconductance level (SCL).• Temperature sensors. Temperature, or thermal, sensorsmeasure body temperature and changes in blood flow.• Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. These elec-trodes are applied to the scalp to measure the electricalactivity of the brain, or brain waves.• Heart rate sensors. A pulse monitor placed on the fingertip can monitor pulse rate.• Respiratory sensors. Respiratory sensors monitor oxy-gen intake and carbon dioxide output.
Precautions
Individuals who use a pacemaker or otherimplantable electrical devices should inform theirbiofeedback therapist before starting treatments, as cer-tain types of biofeedback sensors have the potential tointerfere with these devices.Biofeedback may not be suitable for some patients.Patients must be willing to take a very active role in thetreatment process. And because biofeedback focusesstrictly on behavioral change, those patients who wish togain insight into their symptoms by examining their pastmight be better served by psychodynamic therapy.Biofeedback may also be inappropriate for cogni-tively impaired individuals, such as those patients withorganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury, depend-ing on their levels of functioning.Patients with specific pain symptoms of unknownorigin should undergo a thorough medical examinationbefore starting biofeedback treatments to rule out anyserious underlying disease. Once a diagnosis has beenmade, biofeedback can be used concurrently with con-ventional treatment.Biofeedback may only be one component of a com-prehensive treatment plan. For illnesses and symptomsthat are manifested from an organic disease process, suchas canceror diabetes, biofeedback should be an adjunctto (complementary to), and not a replacement for, con-ventional medical treatment.Side effects
There are no known side effects to properly adminis-tered biofeedback or neurofeedback sessions.
Research and general acceptance
Preliminary research published in late 1999 indicat-ed that neurofeedback may be a promising new tool inthe treatment of schizophrenia. Researchers reportedthat schizophrenic patients had used neurofeedback tosimulate brain wave patterns that antipsychotic medica-tions produce in the brain. Further research is needed todetermine what impact this may have on treatment forschizophrenia.The use of biofeedback techniques to treat an array ofdisorders has been extensively described in the medical lit-erature. Controlled studies for some applications are limit-ed, such as for the treatment of menopausal symptoms andpremenstrual disorder (PMS). There is also some debateover the effectiveness of biofeedback in ADHD treatment,and the lack of controlled studies on that application. Whilemany therapists, counselors, and mental health profession-als have reported great success with treating their ADHDpatients with neurofeedback techniques, some criticsattribute this positive therapeutic impact to a placebo effect.There may also be some debate among mentalhealth professionals as to whether biofeedback should beconsidered a first line treatment for some mental illness-es, and to what degree other treatments, such as medica-tion, should be employed as an adjunct therapy.

Bipolar disorder
Definition
Bipolar, or manic-depressive disorder, is a mood dis-order that causes radical emotional changes and moodswings, from manic highs to depressive lows. The major-ity of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodesof maniaand depression.
Description
In the United States alone, bipolar disorder afflictsalmost two million people at an annual cost of over $45billion, according to a report by the National Institutes ofMental Health. The average age of onset of bipolar disor-der is from adolescence through the early twenties. How-ever, because of the complexity of the disorder, a correctdiagnosis can be delayed for several years or more. In asurvey of bipolar patients conducted by the NationalDepressive and Manic Depressive Association(MDMDA), one-half of respondents reported visitingthree or more professionals before receiving a correctdiagnosis, and over one-third reported a wait of ten yearsor more before they were correctly diagnosed.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders,Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the diagnostic stan-dard for mental health professionals in the United States,defines four separate categories of bipolar disorder: bipo-lar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia, and bipolar not-otherwise-specified (NOS).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 485Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 485Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manicepisodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. Abipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings ofself-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased socia-bility, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities,coupled with the characteristics of irritability, impa-tience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreasedneed for sleep. Usually this manic period is followed bya period of depression, although a few bipolar I individu-als may not experience a major depressive episode.Mixed states, where both manic or hypomanic symptomsand depressive symptoms occur at the same time, alsooccur frequently with bipolar I patients (for example,depression with the racing thoughts of mania). Also, dys-phoric mania is common (mania characterized by angerand irritability).Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres-sive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, amilder form of mania. Bipolar depression may be diffi-cult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressiveepisode. Patients with bipolar depression tend to haveextremely low energy, retarded mental and physicalprocesses, and more profound fatigue(for example,hypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked by a need forexcessive sleep or sleepiness when awake) than unipolardepressives.Cyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanicepisodes with depression that does not reach major depres-sive proportions. A third of patients with cyclothymia willdevelop bipolar I or II disorder later in life.A phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in upto 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,manic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently;at least 4 times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic defi-nition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the patientmay bounce between manic and depressive states severaltimes within a 24-hour period. This condition is veryhard to distinguish from mixed states.Bipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that donot clearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia diag-noses.
Causes and symptoms
The source of bipolar disorder has not been clearlydefined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have afamily history of affective or emotional disorders,researchers have searched for a genetic link to the disor-der. Several studies have uncovered a number of possiblegenetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar dis-order. Another possible biological cause under investiga-tion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up inthe cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and otherneurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated inbipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation.Over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorderhave a history of substance abuse. There is a high rate ofassociation between cocaineabuse and bipolar disorder.Some studies have shown up to 30% of abusers meetingthe criteria for bipolar disorder. The emotional and physi-cal highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to themanic depression of the bipolar patient, making the dis-order difficult to diagnosis.For some bipolar patients, manic and depressiveepisodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressiveepisodes are typical during winter and fall, and manicepisodes are more probable in the spring and summermonths.Symptoms of bipolar depressive episodes includelow energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen-trating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation(slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manicepisodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lackof inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need forsleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. Inextreme cases, mania can induce hallucinationsand other psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.Diagnosis
Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated bya psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis-tance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven-tories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mentalstatus and determine the presence of bipolar symptoms.These include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII (MCMI-III),Minnesota Multiphasic PersonalityInventoryII (MMPI-2), the Internal State Scale (ISS),the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI), and the YoungMania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/orwritten and are administered in both hospital and outpa-tient settings.Psychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri-teria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) as a guide-line for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mentalillnesses. DSM-IVdescribes a manic episode as anabnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period ofat least one week that is distinguished by at least three ofthe mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreasedneed for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis-tractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces-sive involvement in pleasurable activities that have ahigh potential for painful consequences. If the mood of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 486Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 486the patient is irritable and not elevated, four of the symp-toms are required.Although many clinicians find the criteria too rigid,a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration of at least fourdays with at least three of the symptoms indicated formanic episodes (four if mood is irritable and not elevat-ed). DSM-IVnotes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman-ic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in socialor occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza-tion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,because hypomanic episodes are characterized by highenergy and goal directed activities and often result in apositive outcome, or are perceived in a positive mannerby the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.Bipolar symptoms often present differently in chil-dren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groupsare typically characterized by more psychotic featuresthan in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz- ophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-tability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,symptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather thanacute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,impulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-nosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). Furthermore, their aggression often leads to violence,which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.Substance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-scription or over-the-counter medication can mask ormimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-stance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-od of detoxificationand abstinence before a mood disor-der is diagnosed and treatment begins.
Treatment
Treatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means ofmedication. A combination of mood stabilizing agentswith antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsantsis used to regulate manic and depressive episodes.Mood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-mazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate themanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,Lithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-quently prescribed drugs available for the treatment ofbipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takesfour to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-stream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction withneuroleptics and/or benzodiazepinesto provide moreimmediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has alsobeen shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres-sion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithiummay not be an effective long-term treatment option forrapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, ormay not respond to it. Possible side effects of the druginclude weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors. Prolonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita- tions, nervousness, the presence of goiter, sweating,and a wide array of other symptoms.)• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsantdrug usually prescribed in conjunction with other moodstabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-lar patients who have not responded well to lithiumtherapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movementare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.As of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA-cleared indication for mania.• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproicacid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available thathas been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-lar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribedalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi-um. Stomach cramps,indigestion,diarrhea, hair loss,appetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain aresome of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val-proate is also approved for the treatment of mania.Because antidepressants may stimulate manicepisodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typicallyshort-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) or, less often,monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolardepression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo-lar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolarpatients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatmentoption for bipolar depression.• SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft),and paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulatinglevels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety, diarrhea,drowsiness,headache, sweating, nausea, sexual prob-lems, and insomniaare all possible side effects of SSRIs.• MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel-zine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system.Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine(found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet toavoid hypotensive side effects.• Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres-sant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the drugis not known, but it has been effective in regulatingbipolar depression in some patients. Side effects ofbupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor,dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, andinsomnia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 487Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 487• ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, has a high successrate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depression,and mania. However, because of the convenience ofdrug treatment and the stigma sometimes attached toECT therapy, ECT is usually employed after all phar-maceutical treatment options have been explored. ECTis given under anesthesia and patients are given a mus-cle relaxant medication to prevent convulsions. Thetreatment consists of a series of electrical pulses thatmove into the brain through electrodes on the patient’shead. Although the exact mechanisms behind the suc-cess of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed thatthis electrical current alters the electrochemicalprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confu-sion are possible side effects immediately following anECT procedure. Temporary memory loss has also beenreported in ECT patients. In bipolar patients, ECT isoften used in conjunction with drug therapy.Adjunct treatments are used in conjunction with along-term pharmaceutical treatment plan:• Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klon-apin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid treat-ment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients untilmania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizingagents can take effect. Sedationis a common effect, andclumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are otherpossible side effects of benzodiazepines.• Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) andhaloperidol (Haldol) are also used to control maniawhile a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproatetakes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can besevere (difficulty in speaking or swallowing,paralysisof the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms,severe restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremorsin fingers and hands, twisting movements of body, andweakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are gener-ally preferred over neuroleptics.• Psychotherapy and counseling. Because bipolar disorderis thought to be biological in nature, therapy is recom-mended as a companion to, but not a substitute for, phar-maceutical treatment of the disease. Psychotherapy, suchas cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be a useful tool inhelping patients and their families adjust to the disorder,in encouraging compliance to a medication regimen, andin reducing the risk of suicide. Also, educative counsel-ing is recommended for the patient and family.Calcium channel blockers(nimodipine, or Nimo-top), typically used to treat anginaand hypotension,h a v e been found effective, in a few small studies, for treatingrapid cyclers. Calcium channel blockers stop the excesscalcium build up in cells that is thought to be a cause ofbipolar disorder. They are usually used in conjunction withother drug therapies such as carbamazepine or lithium.Clozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychoticmedication used to control manic episodes in patientswho have not responded to typical mood stabilizingagents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic, orpreventative treatment, in some bipolar patients. Commonside effects of clozapine include tachycardia (rapid heartrate), hypotension,constipation, and weight gain. Agran-ulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversible conditionin which the white blood cells that typically fight infec-tion in the body are destroyed, is a possible side effect ofclozapine. Patients treated with the drug should undergoweekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts.Risperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychoticmedication that has been successful in controlling maniain several clinical trials when low doses were adminis-tered. The side effects of risperidone are mild comparedto many other antipsychotics (constipation, coughing,diarrhea, dry mouth, headache,heartburn, increasedlength of sleep and dream activity, nausea, runny nose,sore throat, fatigue, and weight gain).Lamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsantmedication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug was used inconjunction with divalproex (divalproate) and/or lithium.Possible side effects of lamotrigine include skin rash,dizziness, drowsiness, headache,nausea and vomiting. rTMS, or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulationis a new and still experimental treatment for the depres-sive phase of bipolar disorder. In rTMS, a large magnet isplaced on the patient’s head and magnetic fields of dif-ferent frequency are generated to stimulate the left frontcortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, rTMS requires no anes-thesia and does not induce seizures.
Alternative treatment
General recommendations include maintaining acalm environment, avoiding over stimulation, gettingplenty of rest, regular exercise, and proper diet. Chineseherbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedbackis effectivein helping some patients control symptoms such as irri-tability, poor self control, racing thoughts, and sleepproblems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral found inmeats and other foods) and high in vitamin C may behelpful in reducing depression.
Prognosis
While most patients will show some positive responseto treatment, response varies widely, from full recovery to acomplete lack of response to all drug and/or ECT therapy.

Bipolar disorder is achronic recurrent illness in over 90% of those afflicted, andone that requires lifelong observation and treatment afterdiagnosis. Patients with untreated or inadequately treatedbipolar disorder have a suicide rate of 15-25% and a nine-year decrease in life expectancy. With proper treatment, thelife expectancy of the bipolar patient will increase by nearlyseven years and work productivity increases by ten years.
Prevention
The ongoing medical management of bipolar disor-der is critical to preventing relapse, or recurrence, ofmanic episodes. Even in carefully controlled treatmentprograms, bipolar patients may experience recurringepisodes of the disorder. Patient education in the form ofpsychotherapy or self-help groups is crucial for trainingbipolar patients to recognize signs of mania and depres-sion and to take an active part in their treatment program.Resources

Birth defects
Definition
Birth defects are physical abnormalities that are pre-sent at birth; they are also called congenital abnormali-ties. More than 3,000 have been identified.
Description
Birth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborninfants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches10% by age five, as more defects become evident and canbe diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns arecaused by birth defects.Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or partof the body. Major defects are structural abnormalitiesthat affect the way a person looks and require medicaland/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are abnormali-ties that do not cause serious health or social problems.When multiple birth defects occur together and have asimilar cause, they are called syndromes. If two or moredefects tend to appear together but do not share the samecause, they are called associations.
Causes and symptoms
The specific cause of many congenital abnormalitiesis unknown, but several factors associated with pregnan- cyand delivery can increase the risk of birth defects.TeratogensAny substance that can cause abnormal develop-ment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a terato-gen. In the first two months after conception, the devel-oping organism is called an embryo; developmentalstages from two months to birth are called fetal. Growthis rapid, and each body organ has a critical period inwhich it is especially sensitive to outside influences.About 7% of all congenital defects are caused by expo-sure to teratogens.
DRUGS. Only a few drugs are known to cause birthdefects, but all have the potential to cause harm. Thalido-mide is known to cause defects of the arms and legs; sev-eral other types also cause problems.• Alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol while preg-nant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcoholsyndrome, which include mental retardation, heart problems, and growth deficiency.•Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens.Tetracycline affects bone growth and discolors theteeth. Drugs used to treat tuberculosiscan lead to hear-ing problems and damage to a nerve in the head (cra-nial). Sulfa drugs are associated with abnormally highlevels of bilirubin in the newborn, which can causedeath.• Anticonvulsants. Drugs given to prevent seizures cancause serious problems in the developing fetus, includ-ing mental retardation and slow growth.• Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents. Several drugsgiven for anxietyand mental illness are known to causespecific defects.• Antineoplastic agents. Drugs given to treat cancercan cause major congenital malformations, especially centralnervous system defects. They may also be harmful to thehealth care worker who is giving them while pregnant.• Hormones. Male hormones may cause masculinizationof a female fetus. A synthetic estrogen (DES) given inthe 1940s and 1950s causes an increased risk of cancerin the adult female children of the mothers whoreceived the drug.• Recreational drugs. Drugs such as LSDhave been asso-ciated with arm and leg abnormalities and central ner-vous system problems in infants. Crack cocainehas also been associated with birth defects. Since drugabusers tend to use many drugs and have poor nutri- tionand prenatal care, it is hard to determine the effectsof individual drugs.
CHEMICALS. Environmental chemicals such asfungicides, food additives, and pollutants are suspectedof causing birth defects, though this is difficult to prove.
RADIATION. Exposure of the mother to high levels ofradiation can cause small skull size (microcephaly), blind-ness,spina bifida, and cleft palate. How severe the defectis depends on the duration and timing of the exposure.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 490Birth defectsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 490INFECTIONS. Three viruses are known to harm adeveloping baby:rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), andherpes simplex. Toxoplasma gondii,a parasite that can becontracted from undercooked meat, from dirt, or fromhandling the feces of infected cats, causes serious prob-lems. Untreated syphilisin the mother is also harmful.Genetic factorsA gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing informa-tion (DNA) that guides how the body forms and func-tions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genesfrom each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes. Genescontrol all aspects of the body, how it works, and all itsunique characteristics, including eye color and body size.Genes are influenced by chemicals and radiation, butsometimes changes in the genes are unexplained acci-dents. Each child gets half of its genes from each parent.In each pair of genes one will take precedence (domi-nant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait,or characteristic. Birth defects caused by dominant inher-itance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla-sia; high cholesterol; Huntington’s disease, a progres-sive nervous system disorder; Marfan syndrome, which affects connective tissue; some forms of glaucoma, and polydactyly (extra fingers or toes).If both parents carry the same recessive gene, theyhave a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit thedisease. Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to anearly death. They include sickle cell anemia, a blood disor-der that affects blacks, and Tay-Sachs disease, which causes mental retardation in people of eastern EuropeanJewish heritage. Two recessive disorders that affect mostlywhites are:cystic fibrosis, a lung and digestive disorder,and phenylketonuria(PKU), a metabolic disorder. If onlyone parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the nor-mal gene received from the other parent will prevent thedisease, but the child will be a carrier. Having the gene isnot harmful to the carrier, but there is the 25% chance ofthe genetic disease showing up in the child of two carriers.Some disorders are linked to the sex-determiningchromosomes passed along by parents. Hemophilia,a condition that prevents blood from clotting, andDuchenne muscular dystrophy, which causes muscleweakness, are carried on the X chromosome. Genetic

The specific cause of many birth defects is unknown, but several factors associated with pregnancy and delivery canincrease the risk of birth defects.These factors include exposure to teratogens, drugs and other chemicals, exposure to radi-ation, and infections present in the womb. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 491defects can also take place when the egg or sperm areforming if the mother or father passes along some faultygene material. This is more common in older mothers.The most common defect of this kind is Down syn-drome, a pattern of mental retardation and physicalabnormalities, often including heart defects, caused byinheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than thenormal pair.A less understood cause of birth defects results fromthe interaction of genes from one or both parents plusenvironmental influences. These defects are thought toinclude:• Cleft lip and palate, which are malformations of themouth• Clubfoot, ankle or foot deformities.• Spina bifida, an open spine caused when the tube thatforms the brain and spinal chord does not close properly.• Water on the brain (hydrocephalus), which causesbrain damage.•Diabetes mellitus, an abnormality in sugar metabolismthat appears later in life.• Heart defects.• Some forms of cancer.A serious illness in the mother, such as an underac-tive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body can-not process sugar, can also cause birth defects in the child.An abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate orcause birth defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur-rounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too lit-tle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop-ment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if thefetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing.Diagnosis
If there is a family history of birth defects or if themother is over 35 years old, then screening tests can bedone during pregnancy to gain information about thehealth of the baby.• Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test thatmeasure the level of a substance called alpha-fetopro-tein that is associated with some major birth defects. Anabnormally high or low level may indicate the need forfurther testing.• Ultrasound. The use of sound waves to examine theshape, function, and age of the fetus is a common proce-dure. It can also detect many malformations, such asspina bifida, limb defects, and heart and kidney problems.• Amniocentesis. This test is usually done between the13th and 15th weeks of pregnancy. A small sample ofamniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needleinserted into the mother’s abdomen. Chromosomalanalysis can rule out Down syndrome and other geneticconditions.• Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be doneas early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identifychromosome disorders and some genetic conditions. Athin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slimtube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tis-sue sample for testing.If a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born,then confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. Thepatient’s medical records and medical history may holdessential information. A careful physical examinationand laboratory tests should be done. Special diagnostictests can also provide genetic information in some cases.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of birth defect andhow serious it is. When an abnormality has been identi-fied before birth, then delivery can be planned at a healthcare facility that is prepared to offer any special careneeded. Some abnormalities can be corrected withsurgery. Experimental procedures have been used suc-cessfully in correcting some defects, like excessive fluidin the brain (hydrocephalus), even before the baby is

Birthmarks
Definition
Birthmarks, including angiomas and vascular mal-formations, are benign (noncancerous) skin growthscomposed of rapidly growing or poorly formed bloodvessels or lymph vessels. Found at birth (congenital) ordeveloping later in life (acquired) anywhere on the body,they range from faint spots to dark swellings coveringwide areas.
Description
Skin angiomas, also called vascular (pertaining tovessel) nevi (marks), are composed of blood vessels(hemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas), thatlie beneath the skin’s surface. Hemangiomas, composedof clusters of cells that line the capillaries, the body’ssmallest blood vessels, are found on the face and neck
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 493BirthmarksGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 493(60%), trunk (25%), or the arms and legs (15%). Con-genital hemangiomas, 90% of which appear at birth orwithin the first month of life, grow quickly, and disap-pear over time. They are found in 1-10% of full-terminfants, and 25% of premature infants. About 65% arecapillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks), 15% are cav-ernous (deep) hemangiomas, and the rest are mixtures.Hemangiomas are three times more common in girls.Usually, only one hemangioma is found, in 20% two arefound, while fewer than 5% have three or more. Lym-phangiomas are skin bumps caused by enlarged lymphvessels anywhere on the body.Vascular malformations are poorly formed blood orlymph vessels that appear at birth or later in life. Onetype, the salmon patch (nevus simplex), a pink markcomposed of dilated capillaries, is found on the back ofthe neck (also called a stork bite) in 40% of newborns,and on the forehead and eyelids (also called an angel’skiss) in 20%. Stork bites are found in 70% of white and60% of black newborns.Found in fewer than 1% of newborns, port-winestains (nevus flammeus), are vascular malformationscomposed of dilated capillaries in the upper and lowerlayers of the skin of the face, neck, arms, and legs. Oftenpermanent, these flat pink to red marks develop into darkpurple bumpy areas in later life; 85% appear on only oneside of the body.Acquired hemangiomas include spider angiomas(nevus araneus), commonly known as spider veins, andcherry angiomas (senile angiomas or Campbell de Mor-gan spots). Found around the eyes, cheekbones, arms,and legs, spider angiomas are red marks formed fromdilated blood vessels. They occur during pregnancyin 70% of white women and 10% of black women, in alco-holics and liver disease patients, and in 50% of children.Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries found mainly on thetrunk, appear in the 30s, and multiply with aging.
Causes and symptoms
There are no known causes for congenital skinangiomas; they may be related to an inherited weakness ofvessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider angiomasin pregnant women or those taking oral contraceptives. Spider angiomas tend to run in families, and may be asso-ciated with liver disease, sun exposure, and trauma.HemangiomasHemangiomas first appear as single or multiple,white or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (average2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while otherscause painor bleeding, or interfere with normal function-ing when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or ulcer-ated. Vision is affected by large marks on the eyelids. Spi-der and cherry angiomas are unsightly but symptomless.Each type of hemangioma has a characteristicappearance:• Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks). Theseround, raised marks are bright red and bumpy like astrawberry, and become white or gray when fading.• Cavernous hemangiomas. These slightly raised, dome-shaped, blue or purple swellings are sometimes associ-ated with lymphangiomas or involve the soft tissues,bone, or digestive tract.• Spider angiomas. These are symptomless, reddish bluemarks formed from blood-filled capillaries radiatingaround a central arteriole (small artery) in the shape ofa spider web.• Cherry angiomas. These harmless, dilated capillariesappear as tiny, bright red-to-violet colored bumps.• Lymphangiomas. These dilated lymph vessels form lightpink or yellow cysts (fluid- filled sacs) or swellings.V ascular malformationsThese are faint, flat, pink stains that grow as thechild grows into larger dark red or purple marks. Someare symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured.Disfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional andsocial problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on theforehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due toinvolvement of the eye and surrounding nerves. Abnor-malities of the spinal cord, soft tissues, or bone may beassociated with severe port-wine stains.Each type has a characteristic appearance:• Salmon patches. These symptomless, light red-to-pinkmarks usually fade with time.• Port-wine stains. These flat, pink marks progress toraised, dark red-to-purple grape-like lumps distortingthe facial features, arms, or legs.
Diagnosis
Patients are treated by pediatricians (doctors whospecialize in the care of children), dermatologists (skindisease specialists), plastic surgeons (doctors who spe-cialize in correcting abnormalities of the appearance),and ophthalmologists (eye disease specialists).Angiomas and vascular malformations are not diffi-cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medicalhistory and performs a physical examinationincluding inspection and palpation of the marks. The skin is exam-ined for discoloration, scarring, bleeding, infection, or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 494BirthmarksGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 494ulceration. The type, location, size, number, and severityof the marks are recorded. The doctor may empty themark of blood by gentle pressure. Biopsies or specializedx rays or scans of the abnormal vessels and their sur-rounding areas may be performed. Patients with port-wine stains near the eye may require skull x rays,com- puted tomography scans, and vision and central ner-vous system tests. Most insurance plans pay for diagno-sis and treatment of these conditions.
Treatment
Treatment choices for skin angiomas and vascularmalformations depend on their type, location, and severity,and whether they cause symptoms, pain, or disfigurement.Watchful waitingNo treatment is given, but the mark is regularly exam-ined. This continues until the mark disappears, or requirestreatment. This approach is particularly appropriate for thetreatment of hemangiomas, which often do not requiretreatment, since they eventually shrink by themselves.Drugs
CORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the anti-inflam-matory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are given for upto 2 months with gradual reduction of the dose. The marksbegin to subside within 7-10 days, but may take up to 2months to fully disappear. If no response is seen in 2weeks, the drug is discontinued. Treatment may be repeat-ed. Side effects include growth retardation, increased bloodpressure and blood sugar,cataracts, glandular disorders,and infection. The corticosteroidstriamcinolone acetateand betamethasone sodium phosphate or acetate are inject-ed directly into the marks with a response usually achievedwithin a week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks.Side effects include tissue damage at the injection site.
INTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cellgrowth, and is used for vascular marks that affect vision,and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids. Given in dailyinjections under the skin, a response rate of 50% isachieved after about 7 months. Side effects include fever, chills, muscle and joint pain, vision disorders, low whiteand red blood cell counts,fatigue, elevated liver enzymes,nausea, blood clotting problems, and nerve damage.
ANTIBIOTICS. Oral or topical (applied to the skin)antibioticsare prescribed for infected marks.Surgery
LASER SURGERY. Lasers create intense heat thatdestroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin, with-out damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers are used:the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and the neodymi-um:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. The FPDL, used mainly forstrawberry marks and port-wine stains, penetrates to adepth of 1.8 mm and causes little scarring, while theNd:YAG laser penetrates to a depth of 6 mm, and is usedto treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgeryis not usuallypainful, but can be uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream isused for FPDL treatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAGlaser requires local or general anesthesia. Children areusually sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2weeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration,swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.SURGICAL EXCISION. Under local or general anes-thesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument, and vas-cular marks or their scars are removed. The cut isrepaired with stitches or skin clips.
CRYOSURGERY. Vascular marks are frozen with anextremely cold substance sprayed onto the skin. Wounds heal with minimal scarring.
ELECTRODESICCATION. Affected vessels are des-troyed with the current from an electric needle.Other treatmentsThese include:• Sclerotherapy. Injection of a special solution causesblood clotting and shrinkage with little scarring. Sideeffects include stinging, swelling, bruising, scarring,muscle cramping, and allergic reactions. This treatmentis used most commonly for spider angiomas.• Embolization. Material injected into the vessel blocksblood flow which helps control blood loss during orreduces the size of inoperable growths. A serious side

Special brands are designed to cover birth-marks (Covermark or Dermablend).• Cleaning and compression. Bleeding marks are cleanedwith soap and water or hydrogen peroxide, and com-pressed with a sterile bandage for 5-10 minutes.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for strengthening weak bloodvessels include eating high-fiber foods and those con-taining bioflavonoids, including citrus fruit, blueberries,and cherries, supplementing the diet with vitamin C, andtaking the herbs, ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) and bilberry(Vaccinium myrtillus.)
Prognosis
The various types of birthmarks have different prog-noses:• Capillary hemangiomas. Fewer than 10% require treat-ment. Without treatment, 50% disappear by age 5, 70%by age 7, and 90% by age 9. No skin changes are foundin half while others have some discoloration, scarring,or wrinkling. From 30-90% respond to oral corticos-KEY TERMS

Prevention
Congenital hemangiomas or vascular malformationscannot be prevented, but spider angiomas may be pre-vented by exercise, weight control, and a high-fiber diet,as well as avoidance of sun exposure, alcohol drinking,or wearing tight hosiery.Resources

Bites and stings
Definition
Humans can be injured by the bites or stings ofmany kinds of animals, including mammals such asdogs, cats, and fellow humans; arthropods such as spi-ders, bees, and wasps; snakes; and marine animals suchas jellyfish and stingrays.
Description
Mammals
DOGS. In the United States, where the dog popula-tion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammalsin the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,most dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey ofU.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers toestimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medicalattention occurred in the United States that year, versus757,000 that did require medical treatment. Studies alsoshow that most dog bites are from pets or other dogsknown to the bitten person, that males are more likelythan females to be bitten, and that children face a greaterrisk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,mostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.Dog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency-room visits annually throughout the United States. Morethan half of the bites seen by emergency departmentsoccur at home. Children under 10 years old, especiallyboys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more likely thanolder people to visit an emergency room for bite treat-ment. Children under 10 years old were also much moreliable to be bitten on the face, neck, and head. Nearly allof the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment inemergency rooms were of “low severity,” and most weretreated and released without being admitted to hospital orsent to another facility. Many of the bites resulted frompeople attempting to break up fights between animals.
CATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third ofU.S. households, cat bites are far less common than dogbites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year. Thetissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, butthey carry a high risk of infection. Whereas the infectionrate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the infection rate forcat bites is 30-40%. A typical person who has been bittenis a young girl playing with a pet.
HUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs andcats are uncommon, with one exception—human bites.There are approximately 70,000 human bites each yearin the United States. Because the human mouth containsa multitude of potentially harmful microorganisms,human bites are more infectious than those of most otheranimals.ArthropodsArthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy-lum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids, crus-taceans, and other subgroups. There are more than700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite orsting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs,fleas, mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, cen-tipedes, scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, andwasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most oftenbite people.
SPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of ven-omous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders andbrown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow, whichis found in every state but Alaska, is probably the mostnotorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry places such asbarns, garages, and outhouses, and also lives under rocksand logs. Disturbing a female black widow or its webmay provoke a bite. Brown spiders also prefer shelteredplaces, including clothing, and may bite if disturbed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 497Bites and stingsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 497BEES AND WASPS. Bees and wasps will sting todefend their nests or if they are disturbed. Species com-mon to the United States include honeybees, bumble-bees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets,and paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized beespecies, also called “killer bees” that are now found inthe United States since 1990. More than fifty Americansdie each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.Almost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reac-tions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.SnakesThere are 20 species of venomous snakes in theUnited States. These snakes are found in every stateexcept Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but nomore than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.The venomous snakes of the United States are divid-ed into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers) and theElapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensingpit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsiblefor about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered byAmericans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths(also called water moccasins) are pit vipers. This familyof snakes delivers its venom through two long, hingedfangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers carry a potentvenom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord. Thevenom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful.The Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven-omous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and west-ern states. Because coral snakes are bashful creaturesthat come out only at night, they almost never bitehumans, and are responsible for approximately 25 bites ayear in the United States. Coral snakes also have shortfangs and a small mouth, which lowers the risk of a biteactually forcing venom into a person’s body. However,their venom is quite poisonous.Marine animalsSeveral varieties of marine animal may bite or sting.Jellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat topeople who live or vacation in coastal communities.
Causes and symptoms
Mammals
DOGS. A typical dog bite results in a laceration, tear,puncture, or crush injury. Bites from large, powerful dogsmay even cause fracturesand dangerous internalinjuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedlyduring a single episode. Infected bites usually cause pain, cellulitis(inflammation of the connective tissues), and apus-filled discharge at the wound site within 8-24 hours.Most infections are confined to the wound site, but manyof the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can causesystemic and possibly life-threatening infections. Exam-ples are bacteremiaand meningitis, especially severe inpeople diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiencysyn- drome (AIDS) or other health condition that increasestheir susceptibility to infection. Rabiesis rare among petdogs in the United States, most of which have been vacci-nated against the disease. Tetanusis also rare but can betransmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized.CATS. The mouths of cats and dogs contain many ofthe same microorganisms. Cat scratches and bites arealso capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselaebac- terium, which can lead to cat-scratch disease,a n unpleasant but usually not life-threatening illness.Cat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands.Sharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncturewound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones, whichare vulnerable to infection because of their comparativelypoor blood supply. This is why cat bites are much morelikely to become infected than dog bites. Also, people areless inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiringimmediate attention; the risk that infection has set in bythe time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater.
HUMANS. Humans bites result from fights, sexualactivity, medical and dental treatment, and seizures. Bitesalso raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse. Chil- dren often bite other children, but those bites are hardlyever severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting awide range of dangerous diseases, including hepatitis B, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Human bites fall into two categories: occlusional(true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former presenta lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very infec-tious and can permanently damage the hand, usuallyresult from a fist hitting teeth during a fight. People oftenwait before seeking treatment for a clenched-fist injury,with the result that about half of such injuries are infect-ed by the time they are seen by a medical professional.Arthropods
SPIDERS. As a rule, people rarely see a black widowbite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The first (andpossibly only) evidence that a person has been bitten maybe a mild swelling of the injured area and two red punc-ture marks. Within a short time, however, some victimsbegin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity ofthe abdominal muscles. Other possible symptoms includeexcessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches, andvertigo as well as breathing, vision, and speech problems.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 498Bites and stingsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 498A brown spider’s bite can lead to necrotic arachni-dism, in which the tissue in an area of up to several inch-es around the bite becomes necrotic (dies), producing anopen sore that can take months or years to disappear. Inmost cases, however, the bite simply produces a hard,painful, itchy, and discolored area that heals withouttreatment in 2-3 days. The bite may also be accompaniedby a fever, chills,edema(an accumulation of excess tis-sue fluid),nausea and vomiting,dizziness, muscle andjoint pain, and a rash.
BEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of beeand wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and itch-iness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can havemuch more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis,a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersen-sitive persons.SnakesVenomous pit viper bites usually begin to swellwithin 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Othersymptoms include skin blisters and discoloration, weak-ness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness, bruising, andtender lymph nodes. Severe poisoningcan also lead totingling in the scalp, fingers, and toes, muscle contrac-tions, an elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, large dropsin body temperature and blood pressure, vomiting ofblood, and coma.Many pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail topoison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only asmall amount of venom into the victim’s body. Thewounds, however, can still become infected by the harm-ful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths.Coral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see.One to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person begins toexperience the effects of the venom, which include tinglingat the wound site, weakness, nausea, vomiting, excessivesalivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of thebody can become paralyzed for 6-14 days, causing doublevision, difficulty swallowing and speaking,respiratoryfailure, and other problems. Six to eight weeks may beneeded before normal muscular strength is regained.Marine animals
JELLYFISH. Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbscalled nematocysts, which are located on the creature’stentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush upagainst them. Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usu-ally result. The pain can continue up to 48 hours. Severecases may lead to skin necrosis,muscle spasms andcramps, vomiting, nausea,diarrhea, headaches, exces-sive sweating, and other symptoms. In rare instances,cardiorespiratory failure may also occur.STINGRAYS. Tail spines are the delivery mechanismfor stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result that cancause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded inthe wound. A typical stingray injury scenario involves aperson who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and islashed in the ankle by its tail. Stingray venom producesimmediate, excruciating pain that lasts several hours.Sometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction, includingvomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in bloodpressure, and cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat).
Diagnosis
Mammals
DOGS. Gathering information on the circumstancesof a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment. Medicalprofessionals need to know when the attack occurred (thechances of infection increase dramatically if the woundhas been left untreated for more than eight hours) andwhat led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more like-ly to be associated with rabies). A person’s general healthmust also be assessed, including the tetanus immuniza-tion history if any, as well as information concerningpossible allergiesto medication and pre-existing healthproblems that may increase the risk of infection.A physical examinationrequires careful scrutiny ofthe wound, with special attention to possible bone, joint,ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel damagecaused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Seri-ous hand injuries should be evaluated by a specializedsurgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests for identifyingthe microorganisms in bite wounds are performed ifinfection is present. X rays and other diagnostic proce-dures may also be necessary.

HUMANS. Testing the blood of a person who hasbeen bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other dis-eases is always necessary after a human bite. Ideally, thebiter should be tested as well for the presence of trans-missible disease. Clenched-fist injuries often requireevaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Becausemany people will deny having been in a fight, medicalprofessionals usually consider lacerations over the fourthand fifth knuckles—the typical result of a clenched-fistinjury—to be evidence of a bite wound. Medical profes-sionals also look for indications of spousal or childabusewhen evaluating human bites.Arthropods
SPIDERS. Because bites from widow spiders andbrown spiders require different treatments, capturing andidentifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.SnakesDiagnosis relies on a physical examination of thevictim, information about the circumstances of the bite,and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be killed andbrought in for identification). Blood tests and urinalysissupply important data on the victim’s condition. Chest x-rays and electrocardiography(a procedure for measur-ing heart activity) may also be necessary.
Treatment
Mammals
DOGS. Minor dog bites can be treated at home. TheAmerican Academy of Family Physicians recommendsgently washing the wound with soap and water and thenapplying pressure to the injured area with a clean towelto stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibioticointment and a sterile bandage to the wound. To reduceswelling and fend off infection, ice should be applied andthe injured area kept elevated above the level of the heart.The wound should be cleaned and covered with ointmenttwice a day until it heals.Any dog bite that does not stop bleeding after 15minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical profes-sional. The same is true for bites that are deep or gaping;for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for bites thatmay have broken a bone, damaged nerves, or caused amajor injury of another kind. Bite victims must alsowatch for infection. A fever is one sign of infection, asare redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, andpus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS orcancer, individuals who have not had a tetanus shot infive years, and anyone else who has a medical problemthat can increase susceptibility to infection should seekmedical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears.Medical treatment of dog bites involves washing thewound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of deadand damaged tissue (under local, regional, or generalanesthetic) may be required after the wound has beenwashed, and any person whose tetanus shots are not up todate should receive a booster injection. Some wounds areleft open and allowed to heal on their own, while othersrequire stitches (stitching may be delayed a few days ifinfection is a concern). Many emergency departmentsprescribe antibioticsfor all people with dog bites, butsome researchers suggest that antibiotics are usuallyunnecessary and should be limited to those whoseinjuries or other health problems make them likely candi-dates for infection. A follow-up visit after one or twodays is generally required for anyone who has receivedbite treatment.CATS. Because of the high risk of infection, peoplewho are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Catscratches do not require professional medical treatmentunless the wound appears infected or the scratched per-son has a weakened immune system.Medical treatment for cat bites generally follows theprocedures used for dog bites. Experts advise, however,that cat-bite wounds should always be left open to pre-vent infection. Persons who have been bitten by cats gen-erally receive antibiotics as a preventive measure.
HUMANS. Human bites should always be examinedby a doctor. Such bites are usually treated with antibi-otics and left open because of the high risk of infection.A person who has been bitten may also require immu-nization against hepatitis B and other diseases. Persons

SPIDERS. No spider bite should be ignored. The anti-dote for severe widow spider bites is a substance calledantivenin, which contains antibodies taken from theblood serum of horses injected with spider venom. Doc-tors exercisecaution in using antivenin, however,because it can trigger anaphylactic shock, a potentiallydeadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum sickness, an inflammatory response that can give rise tojoint pain, a fever,rashes, and other unpleasant, thoughrarely serious, consequences.An antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well,but it is not yet available in the United States. The drugdapsone, used to treat leprosy, can sometimes stop thetissue deathassociated with a brown spider bite. Necrot-ic areas may need debridement(removal of dead anddamaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications, anti- histamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are a few of theother treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bitefrom a brown spider or widow spider.
BEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated athome. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scrapedoff with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of paper(using tweezers may push more venom out of the venomsac and into the wound). The area should be cleaned andcovered with an ice pack. Aspirinand other pain med-ications, oral antihistamines, and calamine lotion aregood for treating minor symptoms. Putting meat tender-izer on the wound has no effect.Persons who have been stung and experience anallergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medicalhistory, require immediate medical attention. The dangersigns, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individualis stung (though possibly not for several hours), includenausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps, diar-rhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.SnakesAlthough most snakes are not venomous, anysnakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.While waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victimshould wash the wound site with soap and water, andthen keep the injured area still and at a level lower thanthe heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site norshould attempts be made to suck out the venom. Makinga cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is importantto stay calm and wait for emergency medical aid if it canarrive quickly. Otherwise, the victim should proceeddirectly to a hospital.When the victim arrives at a hospital, the medicalstaff must determine whether the bite was inflicted by avenomous snake and, if so, whether envenomationoccurred and how much venom the person has received.

Minor rat-tlesnake envenomations can be successfully treated with-out antivenin, as can copperhead and water-moccasinbites. However, coral snake envenomations and the moredangerous rattlesnake envenomations require antivenin,sometimes in large amounts. Other treatment measuresinclude antibiotics to prevent infection and a tetanusbooster injection.Marine animals

Anesthetic oint-ments, antihistamine creams, and steroid lotions appliedto the skin are sometimes beneficial. Other measuresmay be necessary to counter the many harmful effects ofjellyfish stings, which, if severe, require emergency med-ical care.
STINGRAYS. Stingray wounds should be washedwith saltwater and then soaked in very hot water for 30-90 minutes to neutralize the venom. Afterwards, thewound should be examined by a doctor to ensure that nopieces of spine remain.
Alternative treatment
ArthropodsSeveral alternative self-care approaches are used totreat minor bee, wasp, and other arthropod stings, includ-ing aromatherapy,ayurvedic medicine,flower reme-dies, herbs,homeopathy, and nutritional therapy.
Prognosis
MammalsPrompt treatment and recognizing that even appar-ently minor bites can have serious consequences are thekeys to a good outcome after a mammal bite. Infectedbites can be fatal if neglected. Surgery and hospitaliza-tion may be needed for severe bites.Arthropods
SPIDERS. Even without treatment, adults usuallyrecover from black widow bites after 2-3 days. Thosemost at risk of dying are very young children, the elderly,and people with high blood pressure. In the case ofbrown spider bites, the risk of death is greatest for chil-dren, though rare.
BEES AND WASPS. The pain and other symptoms of abee or wasp sting normally fade away after a few hours.People who are allergic to such stings, however, canexperience severe and occasionally fatal anaphylaxis.SnakesA snakebite victim’s chances of survival are excel-lent if medical aid is obtained in time. Some bites, how-ever, result in amputation, permanent deformity, or lossof function in the injured area.Marine animals
STINGRAYS. Stingray venom kills its human victimson rare occasions.Prevention
Mammals
DOGS. The risk of a dog bite injury can be reducedby avoiding sick or stray dogs, staying away from dog-fights (people often get bitten when they try to separate theanimals), and not behaving in ways that might provoke orupset dogs, such as wrestling with them or bothering themwhile they are sleeping, eating, or looking after their pup-pies. Special precautions need to be taken around infantsand young children, who must never be left alone with adog. Pit bulls, rottweilers, and German shepherds (respon-sible for nearly half of all fatal dog attacks in the UnitedStates in 1997-2000) are potentially dangerous pets inhouseholds where children live or visit. For all breeds ofdog, obedience training as well as spaying or neuteringlessen the chances of aggressive behavior.
CATS. Prevention involves warning children to stayaway from strange cats and to avoid rough play and otherbehavior that can anger cats and cause them to bite.Arthropods
SPIDERS. Common-sense precautions include clear-ing webs out of garages, outhouses, and other placesfavored by venomous spiders; keeping one’s hands awayfrom places where spiders may be lurking; and, whencamping or vacationing, checking clothing, shoes, andsleeping areas.
BEES AND WASPS. When possible, avoid the nests ofbees and wasps and do not eat sweet food or wear brightclothing, perfumes, or cosmetics that attract bees andwasps.Emergency medical kits containing self-administra-ble epinephrine to counter anaphylactic shock are avail-able for allergic people and should be carried by them atall times. People who suspect they are allergic shouldconsult an allergist about shots that can reduce reactionsto bee and wasp venom.SnakesSnakes should not be kept as pets. Measures such asmowing the lawn, keeping hedges trimmed, and remov-ing brush from the yard also discourages snakes from liv-ing close to human dwellings. Tongs should be used tomove brush, lumber, and firewood, to avoid exposingone’s hands to snakes that might be lying underneath.Similarly, golfers should never use their hands to retrievegolf balls from a water hole, since snakes can be hidingin the rocks and weeds. Caution is also necessary whenwalking through weedy or grassy areas, and childrenshould be prevented from playing in weedy, vacant lots

Leather bootsand long pants offer hikers and campers some protectionfrom bites. Approaching a snake, even a dead one, can bedangerous, for the venom of recently killed snakes maystill be active.Marine animals
JELLYFISH. Prevention of jellyfish stings includesobeying posted warning signs at the beach. Also, jelly-fish tentacles may be transparent and up to 120 ft (36.5m) long, therefore great caution must be exercised when-ever a jellyfish is sighted nearby.
STINGRAYS. Shuffling while walking through shal-low areas that may be inhabited by stingrays will disturbthe water, causing the animal to move before it can bestepped on.Resources

Black lung disease
Definition
Black lung disease is the common name for coalworkers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, alung disease of older workers in the coal industry,caused by inhalation, over many years, of smallamounts of coal dust.
Description
The risk of having black lung disease is directlyrelated to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; thedisease typically affects workers over age 50. Its com-mon name comes from the fact that the inhalation ofheavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs lookblack instead of a healthy pink. Although people wholive in cities often have some black deposits in theirlungs from polluted air, coal miners have much moreextensive deposits.In the years since the federal government has regu-lated dust levels in coal mines, the number of cases ofblack lung disease has fallen sharply. Since the FederalCoal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, average dustlevels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic meter to thecurrent standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic meter. The 1969law also set up a black lung disability benefits programto compensate coal miners who have been disabled byon-the-job dust exposure.Despite the technology available to control thehazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop-ing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any xray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is suchevidence, it often shows up as only small black spotsless than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may havebeen caused by smokingrather than coal dust. Thiscondition is called “simple CWP” and does not lead tosymptoms or disability.
Causes and symptoms
Since the particles of fine coal dust, which a minerbreathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyedwithin the lungs or removed from them, builds up. Even-tually, this build-up causes thickening and scarring,making the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen tothe blood.The primary symptom of the disease is shortness ofbreath, which gradually gets worse as the disease pro-gresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop cor pul- monale, an enlargement and strain of the right side of theheart caused by chronic lung disease. This may eventual-ly cause right-sided heart failure.

Othersdevelop a severe type of black lung disease called pro-gressive massive fibrosis, in which damage continues inthe upper parts of the lungs even after exposure to thedust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure what causes thisserious complication. Some think that it may be due tothe breathing of a mixture of coal and silica dust that isfound in certain mines. Silica is far more likely to lead toscarring than coal dust alone.
Diagnosis
Black lung disease can be diagnosed by checking apatient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by achest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in thelungs caused by coal dust are present. A pulmonaryfunction testmay aid in diagnosis.X rays can detect black lung disease before it causesany symptoms. If exposure to the dust is stopped at thatpoint, progression of the disease may be prevented.
Treatment
There is no treatment or cure for this condition,although it is possible to treat complications such as lunginfections and cor pulmonale. Further exposure to coaldust must be stopped.KEY TERMS
Emphysema—A disease in which the tiny air sacsin the lungs become damaged, leading to short-ness of breath, and respiratory and heart failure.Fibrosis—The growth of scar tissue, often as aresponse to injury, infection, or inflammation.Pulmonary function test—A group of proceduresused to evaluate the function of the lungs and con-firm the presence of certain lung disorders.Silica dust—A type of dust from silica (crystallinequartz) which causes breathing problems in work-ers in the fields of mining, stone cutting, quarrying(especially granite), blasting, road and buildingconstruction industries that manufacture abra-sives, and farming. Breathing the dust causes sili-cosis, a severe disease that can scar the lungs.Prognosis
Those miners with simple CWP can lead a normallife. However, patients who develop black lung disease atan early age, or who have progressive massive fibrosis,have a higher risk of premature death.
Prevention
The only way to prevent black lung disease is toavoid long-term exposure to coal dust. Coal mines mayhelp prevent the condition by lowering coal dust levelsand providing protective clothes to coal miners.Resources

Bladder cancer
Definition
Bladder canceris a disease in which the cells liningthe urinary bladder lose the ability to regulate theirgrowth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnormalgrowth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.
Description
Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer inthe United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS)estimates that in 1998, approximately 55,000 new casesof bladder cancer will be diagnosed, and it will cause atleast 12,500 deaths. The disease is three times more com-mon among men than women, and the incidence is alsohigher in caucasians.The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ thatstores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out ofthe body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urinefrom the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries theurine from the bladder to the outside of the body.Bladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.Even after superficial tumors are completely removed,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 506Bladder cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 506there is a 75% chance that new tumors will develop inother areas of the bladder. Hence, patients need very fre-quent and thorough follow-up care.
Causes and symptoms
Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is notknown, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to getthe disease. Hence,smokingis considered the greatestrisk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposedto certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry andin the rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries arebelieved to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The dis-ease is also three times more common in men than inwomen; caucasians also are at an increased risk. The riskof bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases arefound in people who are 50–70 years old.Frequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder stones, and other conditions that cause long-term irrita-tion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting blad-der cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder couldalso increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.One of the first warning signals of bladder cancer isblood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood in theurine to change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or adark red. At other times, the color of the urine appears nor-mal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presenceof blood cells. A change in bladder habits such as painfulurination, increased frequency of urination and a feeling ofneeding to urinate but not being able to do so are some ofthe signs of possible bladder cancer. All of these symptomsmay also be caused by conditions other than cancer, but itis important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluat-ed. When detected early and treated appropriately, patientshave a very good chance of being cured completely.
Diagnosis
If a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, hemay use several tests to find out if the disease is present. Asa first step, a complete medical history will be taken tocheck for any risk factors. A thorough physical examina-tionwill be conducted to assess all the signs and symp-toms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to ruleout the presence of a bacterial infection. In a urine cytologytest, the urine is examined under a microscope to look forany abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can beadvanced into the bladder through the urethra, and a saltsolution is passed through it to wash the bladder. The solu-tion can then be collected and examined under a micro-scope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells.A test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) isan x-ray examination that is done after a dye is injectedinto the blood stream through a vein in the arm. The dyetravels through the blood stream and then reaches thekidneys to be excreted. It clearly outlines the kidneys,

Multiple x rays are taken todetect any abnormality in the lining of these organs.The physician may use a procedure known as a cys- toscopyto view the inside of the bladder. A thin hollowlighted tube is introduced into the bladder through theurethra. If any suspicious looking masses are seen, asmall piece of the tissue can be removed from it using apair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then examinedmicroscopically to verify if cancer is present, and if so, toidentify the type of cancer.If cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicatethat it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in the body,imaging tests such as chest x rays,computed tomographyscans(CT), and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) maybe done to determine which organs are affected. Bladdercancer generally tends to spread to the lungs, liver, and bone.
Treatment
Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the stageof the tumor. The patient’s medical history, overall healthstatus, and personal preferences are also taken intoaccount when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan.The three standard modes of treatment that are availablefor bladder cancer are surgery,radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In addition, newer treatment methodssuch as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy arealso being investigated in clinical trials.Surgery is considered an option only when the diseaseis in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a small areaand has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder, thenthe surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen. Acytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the ure-thra, and the tumor is removed through it. This procedure iscalled a transurethral resection (TUR). Passing a high-ener-gy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the can-cer may treat any remaining cancer. This procedure isknown as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded thewalls of the bladder, surgery will be done through an inci-sion in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can beremoved by partial cystectomy, a procedure where a partof the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or is presentin more than one area of the bladder, a radical cystectomyis done. In this operation, besides the entire bladder, theadjoining organs may also be removed. In men, the prostateis removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fal-lopian tubes are removed.If the entire urinary bladder is removed, then an alter-nate storage place must be created for the urine to bestored before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, apiece of intestine is converted into a small bag andattached to the ureters. This is then connected to an open-ing (stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The proce-dure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures,the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that isplaced over the stoma in the abdominal wall. The bag ishidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionallyby the patient. In a different procedure, the urine is collect-ed in the intestinal sac, but there is no bag on the outside ofthe abdomen. The intestinal sac has to be emptied by thepatient, by placing a drainage tube through the stoma.Radiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to killcancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy anyremaining cancer cells that may not have been removedduring surgery. If the tumor is in a location that makessurgery difficult, or if it is large, radiation may be usedbefore surgery to shrink the tumor. In cases of advancedbladder cancer, radiation therapy is used to ease thesymptoms such as pain, bleeding, or blockage. Radiationcan be delivered by external beam radiation where asource of radiation that is outside the body focuses theradiation on the area of the tumor. Occasionally, a smallpellet of radioactive material may be placed directly intothe cancer. This is known as interstitial radiation therapy.Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugsto destroy thecancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites. Thedrugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting theminto a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill form.Generally a combination of drugs is more effective than anysingle drug in treating bladder cancer. Chemotherapy maybe given following surgery to kill any remaining cancercells. It may also be given even when no remaining cancercells can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.Anticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mit-omycin, may also be instilled directly into the bladder(intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat superficial tumors.Immunotherapy or biological therapy, uses thebody’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treatsuperficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG isa weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosisbacil- lus that stimulates the body’s immune system to fight thecancer. This therapy has been shown to be effective incontrolling superficial bladder cancer.Photodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat-ment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the can-cerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the bladderthat makes the cancer cells more susceptible to light. Fol-lowing that, a special light is shone on the bladder in anattempt to destroy the cancerous cells.
Prognosis
When detected at the early stages, the prognosis forbladder cancer is excellent. At least 94% of the people
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 508Bladder cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 508survive five years or more after initial diagnosis. Howev-er, if the disease has spread to the nearby tissues, the sur-vival rates drop to 49%. If it has metastasized to distantorgans such as the lung, and the liver, commonly only6% of the patients will survive five years or more.
Prevention
Since we do not know what exactly causes bladdercancer, there is no certain way to prevent it. Avoiding riskfactors whenever possible is the best alternative.Since smoking doubles one’s risk of getting bladdercancer, avoiding tobacco may prevent at least half thedeaths that result from bladder cancer. Taking appropriatesafety precautions when working with organic cancer-caus-ing chemicals is another way of preventing the disease.KEY TERMS

Bladder stones
Definition
Bladder stones are crystalline masses that form fromthe mineralsand proteins, which naturally occur inurine. These types of stones are much less common thankidney stones.
Description
Bladder stones can form anywhere in the urinarytract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tinygranules about the size of a grain of sand, but they cangrow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones canblock the flow of urine causing painand difficulty withurination. They can also scratch the bladder wall, whichmay lead to bleeding or infection.
Causes and symptoms
While the exact causes of the formation of bladderstones are not completely understood, bladder stonesusually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of theprostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodiesin the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of fluid intakealso appear to be important factors in the development ofbladder stones.Ninety-five percent of all bladder stones occur inmen, most of who have an enlarged prostategland or aUTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or inAfrican Americans. People with goutmay develop blad-der stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.The symptoms of bladder stones may become evi-dent when the wall of the bladder is scratched or whenthe urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone. Thesesymptoms include:• abnormally dark colored urine• blood in the urine• difficulty urinating• frequent urge to urinate• lower abdominal pain• pain or discomfort in the penisSome people with bladder stones also may experi-ence an inability to control urination (urinary inconti-nence).
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after aphysical examination, which may include a rectal exami-nationto check for enlargement of the prostate gland.Urine tests are then used to determine if there is blood orindications of an UTI in the urine. If bladder stones are sus-pected, bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered. Stones thatare large enough to cause problems with urinary functionare almost always detectable by x ray.
Treatment
Many bladder stones can be passed out of the bodyin the urine. People with small bladder stones will beasked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eighteight-ounce glasses of water per day to increase urinaryoutput. If the stones do not pass after two weeks, or if the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 510Bladder stonesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 510patient’s symptoms become worse, further medical treat-ment may be required.A large bladder stone, or small stone that the patientcannot pass in the urine, may be broken up into smallerstones using ultrasound (shock waves). These smallerstones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot bebroken into pieces by these methods, or that the patientcannot pass, may have to be surgically removed.
Alternative treatment
Traditional herbal remedies for bladder stones includecelery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete blad-der emptying may cause bladder stones, many patientsmay benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improv-ing overall bladder function. These include Kegel exercis-es, which are used to strengthen the muscles involved inurination; herbal supplements (cornsilk, hydrangea,juniper berries, parsley, and uva ursi) used to increaseurine flow and flush out sediment from the bladder; and,the consumption of cranberry juice and/or fresh, unsweet-ened, lemon juice. Cranberry juice helps to control urinarytract infection and contains a chemical that coats the wallsof the bladder, making them more resistant to infection.Lemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system.
Prognosis
Most bladder stones can be, and are, passed out ofthe body in the urine without any permanent damage tothe bladder or the rest of the urinary tract. However, mostbladder stones arise from an underlying medical condi-tion. Therefore, if this medical condition is not correctedapproximately half of all patients will experience a recur-rence of bladder stones within five years.
Prevention
Bladder stones may, in some cases, be prevented bythe patient receiving prompt medical treatment for anenlarged prostate gland or UTI. The consumption of atleast six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water per dayand/or the regular consumption of cranberry juice mayhelp to prevent recurrences of bladder stones.Resources

Bladder training
Definition
Bladder training is a behavioral modification treat-ment technique for urinary incontinencethat involvesplacing a patient on a toileting schedule. The time inter-val between urination is gradually increased in order totrain the patient to remain continent.
Purpose
Bladder training is used to treat urinary urge inconti-nence. Urge incontinence occurs when an individualfeels a sudden need to urinate and cannot control the urgeto do so and, as a consequence, involuntarily loses urinebefore making it to the toilet.
Precautions
Incontinence may be controlled through a number ofinvasive and non-invasive treatment options, includingKegel exercises,biofeedback, bladder training, medica-tion, insertable incontinence devices, and surgery. Eachpatient should undergo a full diagnostic work-up to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 511Bladder trainingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 511determine the type and cause of the incontinence in orderto determine the best course of treatment.
Description
Bladder training may be prescribed and implement-ed by a general physician, urologist, or urogynecologist.A urination schedule is created for the patient. Theschedule typically starts out with fairly short intervalsbetween bathroom breaks (e.g., an hour). As soon as thepatient is able to consistently remain continent for sever-al days at a certain toileting time interval, the time spanis increased. Bladder training continues until the patientregularly achieves continence at a time interval he/shefeels comfortable with.
Preparation
A complete evaluation to determine the cause of uri-nary incontinence is critical to proper treatment. A thor-ough medical history and physical examinationshould be performed on patients considering bladder training.Diagnostic testing may include x rays, ultrasound, urinetests, and a physical examination of the pelvis. It mayinclude a series of exams called urodynamic testing thatmeasure bladder pressure and capacity and the urinaryflow. The patient may also be asked to keep a diary oftheir urination output and frequency and episodes ofincontinence over a period of several days or a week.
Risks
Bladder training may not be successful in allpatients with urge incontinence. Patients who demon-strate a strong desire to control their continence and arecommitted to sticking with a training program tend tohave the most success with bladder training.
Normal results
Patients who undergo successful bladder training gaincomplete or improved control over their urination. In someKEY TERMS

Blastomycosis
Definition
Blastomycosis is an infection caused by inhalingmicroscopic particles (spores) produced by the fungusBlastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis may be limitedto the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In itsmost severe form, the infection can spread throughoutthe body and involve many organ systems (systemic).
Description
Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas- tomyces dermatitidis. Although primarily an airbornedisease, farmers and gardeners may become infectedfrom contact with spores in the soil through cuts andscrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is found inmoist soil and wood in the southeastern United States,the Mississippi River valley, southern Canada, and Cen-tral America. Blastomycosis is also called Gilchrist’s dis-

Canine blastomycosis, a common dog disease, iscaused by the same fungus that infects humans. Howev-er, people do not get this disease from their dogs exceptonly very rarely through dog bites.Blastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six times morecommon in men than in women and tends to more ofteninfect children and individuals in the 30–50 year old agegroup. People who have diabetes mellitusor who aretaking drugs that suppress the immune system (immuno-compromised) are more likely to develop blastomycosis.Although people with AIDScan get blastomycosisbecause of their weakened immune system, blastomyco-sis has not been one of the more common fungal infec-tions associated with AIDS.
Causes and symptoms
Once inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidiscan lodge in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation. This isknown as primary pulmonary blastomycosis. The diseasedoes not spread from one person to another. In the earlystages, symptoms may include a dry cough,fever, heavy sweating,fatigue, and a general feeling of ill health. Inapproximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only thelungs are affected. As the disease progresses, smalllesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep withinthe lungs (alveoli) to break down and form small cavities.In another 35%, the disease involves both the lungsand the skin. Bumps develop on the skin, graduallybecoming small, white, crusted blisters filled with pus.The blisters break open, creating abscesses that do notheal. Approximately 19% of infected people have skinsores without infection in the lungs.The remaining approximately 20% of the infectedpopulation has blastomycosis that has spread or dissemi-nated to other systems of the body. Symptoms mayinclude painand lesions on one or more bones, the malegenitalia, and/or parts of the central nervous system. Theliver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, anddigestive system may also be infected.
Diagnosis
A positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made whenthe fungus B. dermatitidisis identified by direct micro-scopic examination of body fluids such as sputum andprostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from thelung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis isto culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of spu-tum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage, butalone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomy-cosis because any damage caused by other diseases, suchas by pneumoniaor tuberculosis, may appear look onthe x ray. Because its symptoms vary widely, blastomy-cosis is often misdiagnosed.Treatment
Blastomycosis must be treated or it will graduallylead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto-conazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in about 75%of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) given intra-venously is also very effective, but it has more toxic sideeffects than ketoconazole. Treatment with amphotericinB usually requires hospitalization, and the patient mayalso receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuseson creating an internal environment where the funguscannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet lowin dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncookedand unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitaminsC, E, A-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillusacidophilusand Bifidobacteriumwill replenish the goodbacteria in the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, likegarlic (Allium sativum), can be consumed in relativelylarge doses and for an extended period of time in order toincrease effectiveness. A variety of antifungal herbs,such as myrrh (Commiphora molmol), tea tree oil(Melaleucaspp.), citrus seed extract, pau d’arco tea

Prognosis
Left untreated, blastomycosis gradually leads todeath. When treated, however, patients begin to improvewithin one week and, with intensive treatment, may becured within several weeks. The highest rate of recoveryis among patients who only have skin lesions. People with the disseminated form of the disease are least likelyto be cured and and most likely to suffer a relapse.
Prevention
Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is air-borne and microscopic, the only form of prevention is toavoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil. Formany people this is impractical. Since the disease is rare,people who maintain general good health do not need toworry much about infection.Resources

Bleeding time
Definition
Bleeding time is a crude test of hemostasis (the arrestor stopping of bleeding). It indicates how well plateletsinteract with blood vessel walls to form blood clots.
Purpose
Bleeding time is used most often to detect qualitativedefects of platelets, such as V on Willebrand’s disease. Thetest helps identify people who have defects in theirplatelet function. This is the ability of blood to clot fol-lowing a wound or trauma. Normally, platelets interactwith the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clot.There are many factors in the clotting mechanism, andthey are initiated by platelets. The bleeding time test isusually used on patients who have a history of prolongedbleeding after cuts, or who have a family history of bleed-ing disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimesperformed as a preoperative test to determine a patient’slikely bleeding response during and after surgery. Howev-er, in patients with no history of bleeding problems, orwho are not taking anti-inflammatory drugs, the bleedingtime test is not usually necessary.
Precautions
Before administering the test, patients should bequestioned about what medications they may be taking.Some medications will adversely affect the results of thebleeding time test. These medications include anticoagu-lants,diuretics,anticancer drugs,sulfonamides, thi- azide,aspirinand aspirin-containing preparations, andnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The test mayalso be affected by anemia (a deficiency in red bloodcells). Since the taking of aspirin or related drugs are themost common cause of prolonged bleeding time, noaspirin should be taken two weeks prior to the test.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 514Bleeding timeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 514Description
There are four methods to perform the bleedingtest. The Ivy method is the traditional format for thistest. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is placedon the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM Hg. A lancet orscalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on theunderside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loadedblade device is most commonly used to make a stan-dard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that nosuperficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, becauseof their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial-ly in people with bleeding defects. The time from whenthe stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped ismeasured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec-onds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw offthe blood. The test is finished when bleeding hasstopped completely.The three other methods of performing the bleedingtest are the template, modified template, and Dukemethods. The template and modified template methodsare variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure cuffis used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in theIvy method. A template is placed over the area to bestabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm usingthe template as a location guide. The main differencebetween the template and the modified method is thelength of the cut made.For the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear lobeor a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in the Ivymethod, the test is timed from the start of bleeding untilbleeding is completely stopped. The disadvantage to theDuke method is that the pressure on the blood veins inthe stab area is not constant and the results achieved areless reliable. The advantage to the Duke method is thatno scar remains after the test. The other methods mayresult in a tiny, hairline scar where the wound was made.However, this is largely a cosmetic concern.
Preparation
There is no special preparation required of thepatient for this test. The area to be stabbed should bewiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should beleft on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at thewound site. The alcohol must be removed before stab-bing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect thetests results by inhibiting clotting.
Aftercare
If a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknownfactors or diseases, further testing is required to identifythe exact cause of the bleeding problem.KEY TERMS
Hemostasis—The stopping of bleeding or bloodflow through a blood vessel or organ.
Normal results
A normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is lessthan five minutes from the time of the stab until allbleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend thenormal range to eight minutes. Normal values for thetemplate method range up to eight minutes, while forthe modified template methods, up to 10 minutes isconsidered normal. Normal for the Duke method isthree minutes.
Abnormal results
A bleeding time that is longer than normal is anabnormal result. The test should be stopped if the patienthasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes. Bleeding timeis longer when the normal function of platelets isimpaired, or there are a lower-than-normal number ofplatelets in the blood.A longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicatethat one of several defects in hemostasis is present,including severe thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunc-tion, vascular defects, V on Willebrand’s disease, or otherabnormalities.Resources

Bleeding varices
Definition
Bleeding varices are bleeding, dilated (swollen)veins in the esophagus (gullet), or the upper part of thestomach, caused by liver disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 515Bleeding varicesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 515Description
Engorged veins are called varices (plural of varix).Varices may occur in the lining of the esophagus, thetube that connects the mouth to the stomach, or in theupper part of the stomach. Such varices are calledesophageal varices. These varices are fragile and canbleed easily because veins are not designed to handlehigh internal pressures.
Causes and symptoms
Liver disease often causes an increase in the bloodpressure in the main veins that carry blood from thestomach and intestines to the liver (portal veins). As thepressure in the portal veins increases, the veins of thestomach and esophagus swell, until they eventuallybecome varices. Bleeding varices are a life-threateningcomplication of this increase in blood pressure (portalhypertension). The most common cause of bleedingvarices is cirrhosisof the liver caused by chronic alcoholabuse or hepatitis. Bleeding varices occur in approxi-mately one in every 10,000 people.Symptoms of bleeding varices include• vomiting blood, sometimes in massive amounts• black, tarry stools• decreased urine outputKEY TERMS
Cirrhosis of the liver—A type of liver disease, mostoften caused by chronic alcohol abuse. It is charac-terized by scarring of the liver, which leads to anincrease in the blood pressure in the portal veins.Endoscopy—Medical imaging technique for visual-izing the interior of a hollow organ.Esophagus—The tube in the body which takes foodfrom the mouth to the stomach.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)—An imagingtest that involves visually examining the lining ofthe esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum witha flexible fiberoptic endoscope.Portal hypertension—Portal hypertension forces theblood flow backward, causing the portal veins toenlarge and the emergence of bleeding varicesacross the esophagus and stomach from the pressurein the portal vein. Portal hypertension is most com-monly caused by cirrhosis, but can also be seen inportal vein obstruction from unknown causes.Portal veins—The main veins that carry blood fromthe stomach and intestines to the liver.Shock—A state of depression of the vital processesof the body characterized by pallor, a rapid andweak pulse, rapid and shallow respiration, and low-ered blood pressure. Shock results from severe trau-ma, such as crushing injuries, hemorrhage, burns,or major surgery.Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS)—A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemicshunt (TIPS) is a radiology procedure in which atubular device is inserted in the middle of the liverto redirect the blood flow.Varices—A type of varicose vein that develops inveins in the linings of the esophagus and upper stom-ach when these veins fill with blood and swell due toan increase in blood pressure in the portal veins.• excessive thirst• nausea• vomiting• and blood in the vomitIf bleeding from the varices is severe, a patient maygo into shockfrom the loss of blood, characterized bypallor, a rapid and weak pulse, rapid and shallow respira-tion, and lowered systemic blood pressure.
Diagnosis
Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient whohas any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and who haseither been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or whohas a history of prolonged alcohol abuse. The definitivediagnosis is established via a specialized type of endo-scopy, namely,esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD), a procedure that involves the visual examination of the lin-ing of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenumwith a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.
Treatment
The objective during treatment of bleeding varices isto stop and/or prevent bleeding and to restore/maintainnormal blood circulation throughout the body. Patientswith severe bleeding should be treated in intensive caresince uncontrolled bleeding can lead to death.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 516Bleeding varicesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 516Initial treatment of bleeding varices begins with stan-dard resuscitation, including intravenous fluids and bloodtransfusions as needed. Definitive treatment is usuallyendoscopic, with the endoscope used to locate the sites ofthe bleeding. An instrument, inserted along with the endo-scope, is used either to inject these sites with a clottingagent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands.Repeated endoscopic treatments (usually four to six)are generally required to eliminate the varices and to pre-vent the recurrence of bleeding. These endoscopic tech-niques are successful in about 90 percent of cases.Patients who cannot be treated endoscopically maybe considered for an alternative procedure called TIPS(transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). This pro-cedure involves placing a hollow metal tube (shunt) inthe liver connecting the portal veins with the hepaticveins (veins that leave the liver and drain to the heart).This shunt lowers the pressure in the portal veins andprevents bleeding and portal hypertension. The TIPS pro-cedure is performed by a radiologist and has become anaccepted method for reducing portal vein pressure since1992. Although the procedure continues to evolve, TIPScan routinely be created in more than 93% of patients.Medications aimed at controlling bleeding may alsobe prescribed. These include propanolol, vasopressin,octreotide acetate, and isosorbide mononitrate.
Alternative treatment
Some alternative treatments are aimed at preventingthe cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding varicesand most are effective. However, once a patient hasreached the bleeding varice stage, standard intervention tostop the bleeding is required or the patient may die.
Prognosis
Bleeding varices represent one of the most fearedcomplications of portal hypertension. They contribute tothe estimated 32,000 deaths per year attributed to cirrho-sis. Half or more of patients who survive episodes ofbleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal bleed-ing during the first one to two years. The risk of recur-rence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug treatment.Prognosis is usually more related to the underlying liverdisease. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people withbleeding varices will die from this condition within thesix weeks of the first bleeding episode.
Prevention
The best way to possibly prevent the development orrecurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk fac-tors for cirrhosis of the liver. The most common cause ofcirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse, and alcohol con-sumption must be completely eliminated. People withhepatitis Bor hepatitis Calso have an increased risk ofdeveloping cirrhosis of the liver. Vaccinationagainst hepatitis B and avoidance of intravenous drug usagereduce the risk of contracting hepatitis.ResourcesBOOKS

Blepharoplasty
Definition
Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure thatremoves fat deposits, excess tissue, or muscle from theeyelids to improve the appearance of the eyes.
Purpose
The primary use of blepharoplasty is for improvingthe cosmetic appearance of the eyes. In some olderpatients, however, sagging and excess skin surroundingthe eyes can be so extensive that it limits the range ofvision. In those cases, blepharoplasty serves a more func-tional purpose.
Precautions
Before performing blepharoplasty, the surgeon willassess whether the patient is a good candidate for the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 517BlepharoplastyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 517treatment. A good medical history is important. The sur-geon will want to know about any history of thyroid dis-ease,hypertension, or eye problems, which mayincrease the risk of complications.
Description
Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper orlower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skinand fat deposits and the tightening of selected musclessurrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a moreyouthful appearance.The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excessskin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault. Whilethe patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will mark on theskin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken tohide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above andbelow the eye. The patient then receives injections of alocal anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also givethe patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.After a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid skinis removed, the surgeon will work to tease out smallpockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If musclelooseness is also a problem, the surgeon may trim tissueor add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision isclosed with stitches.In some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid maybe the only or primary problem. Such patients may begood candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. Inthis procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur-face of the eyelid, but instead enters from behind to teaseout the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantageof this procedure is that there is no visible scar.
Preparation
Prior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon todiscuss the procedure, clarify the results that can beachieved, and discuss the potential problems that mightoccur. Having realistic expectations is important in anycosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, thatalthough blepharoplasty can improve the appearance ofthe eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel,will be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinklesaround the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C andvitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief thatthis helps the healing process. Patients are also told tostop smokingin the weeks before and after the proce-dure, and to refrain from alcohol and aspirin.
Aftercare
An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of stitch-es for several days after surgery. Patients also take an

Closing the incisionsPinching the redundant skin
The illustration above depicts a procedure to eliminate der-mochalasia, or baggy skin around the eyes. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 518antibiotic several times a day to prevent infection. Ice-cold compresses are applied to the eyes continuously forthe first day following surgery, and several times a day forthe next week or so, to reduce swelling. Some swellingand discoloration around the eyes is expected with theprocedure. Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic bev-erages for one week and should limit their activities,including bending, straining, and lifting. The stitches areremoved a few days after surgery. Patients can generallyreturn to their usual activities within a week to 10 days.
Risks
As with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty canlead to infection and scarring. Good care of the wound fol-lowing surgery can minimize these risks. In cases wheretoo much skin is removed from the eyelids, the patientmay have difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndromemay develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to lubri-cate the eye. In a rare complication, called retrobulbarhematoma, a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball.
Normal results
Most patients can expect good results from blepharo-plasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat pro-ducing a more youthful appearance. Some swelling anddiscoloration is expected immediately following the pro-cedure, but this clears in time. Small scars will be leftwhere the surgeon has made incisions; but these generallylighten in appearance over several months, and, if placedcorrectly, will not be readily noticeable.
Abnormal results
As noted, if too much excess skin is removed fromthe upper eyelid, the patient may be unable to close hiseyes completely; another surgery to correct the defectmay be required. Similarly, too much skin can beremoved from the lower eyelid, allowing too much of thewhite of the eye (the sclera) to show. In extreme cases,the lower lid may be pulled down too far, revealing theunderlying tissue. Called an ectropion, this, too, mayrequire a second, corrective surgery. The eye’s ability tomake tears may also be compromised, leading to dry eyesyndrome. Dry eye syndrome is potentially dangerous; inrare cases it leads to damage to the cornea of the eye andvision loss.Resources

Blood-viscosity reducing drugs
Definition
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs are medicines thatimprove blood flow by making the blood less viscous(sticky).
Purpose
The main use of blood-viscosity reducing drugs is torelieve painful leg cramps caused by poor circulation, acondition called intermittent claudication. Physicians
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 519Blood-viscosity reducing drugsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 519also may prescribe this medicine for other conditions,including stroke,impotence, male infertility,Ray- naud’s disease, and nerve and circulation problemscaused by diabetes.
Description
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs are available onlywith a physician’s prescription and come in extended-release tablet form. Examples of blood-viscosity reducingdrugs are pentoxifylline (Trental) and oxypentifylline.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults is 400 mg, two to threetimes a day, with meals. However, the dose may be dif-ferent for different patients. Check with the physicianwho prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled theprescription for the correct dosage. Dosages for childrenmust be determined by a physician.Taking an antacid with this medicine may help pre-vent upset stomach.
Precautions
This medicine may relieve leg painthat results frompoor circulation, but it should not be considered a substi-tute for other treatments the physician recommends, suchas physical therapy or surgery.This medicine may take several weeks to producenoticeable results. Be sure to keep taking it as directed,even if it doesn’t seem to be helping.Patients being treated with this medicine should notsmoke, as smokingmay worsen the conditions for whichthe medicine is prescribed.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to pentoxi-fylline, aminophylline,caffeine, dyphylline, ethylenedi-amine (contained in aminophylline), oxtriphylline, theo-bromine, or theophylline in the past should let his or herphysician know before taking a blood-viscosity reducingdrug. The physician should also be told about any aller- giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.KEY TERMS
Raynaud’s disease—A blood vessel disorder inwhich the fingers and toes become numb and turnwhite when exposed to cold.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or whomay become pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using a blood-viscosity reducing drug.Older people may be especially sensitive to theeffects of this medicine, which may increase the chanceof side effects.Before using blood-viscosity reducing drugs, peoplewith any of these medical problems should make suretheir physicians are aware of their conditions:• recent stroke• any condition in which there is an increased chance ofbleeding• kidney disease• liver disease
Side effects
Minor discomforts, such as dizziness,headache, upset stomach, nausea, or vomiting usually go away asthe body adjusts to the drug and do not require medicaltreatment unless they persist or they interfere with nor-mal activities.More serious side effects are rare. However, if theseor any other unusual or troublesome symptoms occur,check with the physician who prescribed the medicine assoon as possible:• chest pain• irregular heartbeat
Interactions
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs may interact with aother medicines, changing the effects of one or both ofthe drugs or increasing the risk of side effects. Anyonewho takes blood-viscosity reducing drugs should let thephysician know all other prescription or nonprescription(over-the-counter) medicines he or she is taking. Amongthe drugs that may interact with blood-viscosity reducingdrugs are:• anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin)(also calledblood thinners or clot inhibitors)• calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem (Cardizem),used to treat high blood pressure• angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors suchas enalapril (Vasotec), used to treat high blood pressure• theophylline (Theo-Dur)• medicines such as cimetidine (Tagamet), taken forulcers or heartburnNancy Ross-Flanigan

Definition
One of the most commonly ordered clinical labora-tory tests, a blood count, also called a complete bloodcount (CBC), is a basic evaluation of the cells (red bloodcells, white blood cells, and platelets) suspended in theliquid part of the blood (plasma). It involves determiningthe numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the differ-ent types of blood cells.
Purpose
The CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic testthat is often done as part of a routine physical examina-tion. It can provide valuable information about the bloodand blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow),as well as other body systems. Abnormal results can indi-cate the presence of a variety of conditions—includinganemias, leukemias, and infections—sometimes beforethe patient experiences symptoms of the disease.
Description
A complete blood count is actually a series of testsin which the numbers of red blood cells, white bloodcells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are count-ed. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content andthe packed cell volume (hematocrit) of the red bloodcells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood cells,and determines the types and percentages of white bloodcells. Components of the complete blood count (hemo-globin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) canalso be tested separately, and are sometimes done thatway when a doctor wants to monitor a specific condition,such as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed withleukemia, or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recent-ly received a blood transfusion. Because of its value,though, as an indicator of a person’s overall health, theCBC package is most frequently ordered.The blood count is performed relatively inexpen-sively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use sometype of automated equipment to dilute the blood, samplea measured volume of the diluted suspension, and countthe cells in that volume. In addition to counting actualnumbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, the auto-mated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin andcalculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices(measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the redblood cells). Technologists then examine a stained bloodsmear under the microscope to identify any abnormali-ties in the appearance of the red blood cells and to reportthe types and percentages of white blood cells observed.The red blood cell (RBC) count determines the totalnumber of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of blood.The red cells, the most numerous of the cellular ele-ments, carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues.Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-iron compound in thered blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen. Itsconcentration corresponds closely to the RBC count.Also closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values isthe hematocrit (Hct), which measures the percentage ofred blood cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit(expressed as percentage points) is normally about threetimes the hemoglobin concentration (reported as gramsper deciliter).Red blood cell indices provide information about thesize and hemoglobin content of the red cells. They areuseful in differentiating types of anemias. The indicesinclude four measurements that are calculated using theRBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit results. Meancorpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the aver-age size of the red blood cells and indicates whether thatis small, large or normal. The red blood cell distributionwidth (RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBCsize. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures theaverage amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a redblood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscularhemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the aver-age concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.The white blood cell (WBC) count determines thetotal number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood

Fewer in number than the red cells, WBCs arethe body’s primary means of fighting infection. There arefive main types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes,monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of whichplays a different role in responding to the presence offoreign organisms in the body. A differential white cellcount is done by staining a smear of the patient’s bloodwith a Wright’s stain, allowing the different types ofwhite cells to be clearly seen under the microscope. Atechnologist then counts a minimum of 100 WBCs andreports each type of white cell as a percentage of the totalwhite blood cells counted.The platelet countis an actual count of the numberof platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.Platelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,are involved in blood clotting. Because platelets canclump together, the automated counting method is sub-ject to a certain level of error and may not be accurateenough for low platelet counts. For this reason, very lowplatelet levels are often counted manually.
Normal results
Blood count values can vary by age and sex. Thenormal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2–5.4 millionRBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6–5.0 mil-lion for women. Hemoglobin values range from 14–18grams per deciliter of blood for men and 12–16 grams forwomen. The normal hematocrit is 42–54% for men and36–48% for women. The normal number of white bloodcells for both men and women is approximately4,000–10,000 WBCs per microliter of blood.
Abnormal results
Abnormal blood count results are seen in a variety ofconditions. One of the most common is anemias, whichare characterized by low RBC counts, hemoglobins, andhematocrits. Infections and leukemias are associatedwith increased numbers of WBCs.Resources

Definition
A blood culture is done when a person has symp-toms of a blood infection, also called bacteremia. Blood is drawn from the person one or more times and is testedin a laboratory to find and identify any microorganismpresent and growing in the blood. If a microorganism isfound, more testing is done to determine the antibioticsthat will be effective in treating the infection.
Purpose
Bacteremia is a serious clinical condition and canlead to death. To give the best chance for effective treat-ment and survival, a blood culture is done as soon as aninfection is suspected.Symptoms of bacteremia are fever, chills, mentalconfusion,anxiety, rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,blood clotting problems, and shock. These symptoms areespecially significant in a person who already has anoth-er illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has troublefighting infections because of a weak immune system.Often, the blood infection results from an infectionsomewhere else in the body that has now spread.Additionally, blood cultures are done to find thecauses of other infections. These include bacterial pneu- monia(an infection of the lung), and infectious endo- carditis(an infection of the inner layer of the heart).Both of these infections leak bacteria into the blood.After a blood infection has been diagnosed, con-firmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood cul-ture may be done to make sure the infection is gone.
Description
Culture strategiesThere are many variables involved in performing ablood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn, thephysician must make several decisions based on a knowl-edge of infections and the person’s clinical condition andmedical history.Several groups of microorganisms, including bacte-ria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood infections.The bacteria group can be further broken down into aer-obes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do not need oxygen tolive. They can grow with oxygen (aerobic microbes) orwithout oxygen (anaerobic microbes).Based on the clinical condition of the patient, thephysician determines what group of microorganisms islikely to be causing the infection and then orders one or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 522Blood cultureGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 522more specific types of blood culture, including aerobic,anaerobic, viral, or fungal (for yeasts and molds). Eachspecific type of culture is handled differently by the labo-ratory. Most blood cultures test for both aerobic andanaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral, and mycobacterialblood cultures can also be done, but are less common.The physician must also decide how many bloodcultures should be done. One culture is rarely enough,but two to three are usually adequate. Four cultures areoccasionally required. Some factors influencing thisdecision are the specific microorganisms the physicianexpects to find based on the person’s symptoms or previ-ous culture results, and whether or not the person has hadrecent antibiotic therapy.The time at which the cultures are to be drawn isanother decision made by the physician. During mostblood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microor-ganisms enter the blood at various time intervals. Blooddrawn randomly may miss the microorganisms. Sincemicroorganisms enter the blood 30–90 minutes before theperson’s fever spikes, collecting the culture just after thefever spike offers the best likelihood of finding themicroorganism. The second and third cultures may becollected at the same time, but from different places onthe person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour intervals,as the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia,such as infective endocarditis, microorganisms are alwaysin the blood and the timing of culture collection is lessimportant. Blood cultures should always be collectedbefore antibiotic treatment has begun.Laboratory analysisBacteria are the most common microorganismsfound in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a bacte-rial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungalculture and significantly from that of a viral culture.Blood is drawn from a person and put directly into ablood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth. Afterthe laboratory receives the blood culture bottle, severalprocesses must be completed:• provide an environment for the bacteria to grow• detect the growth when it occurs• identify the bacteria that grow• test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determinewhich antibiotic will be effectiveThere are several types of systems, both manual andautomated, available to laboratories to carry out theseprocesses.The broth in the blood culture bottle is the first stepin creating an environment in which bacteria will grow. Itcontains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow. If thephysician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow, oxygenwill be kept out of the blood culture bottle; if aerobes areexpected, oxygen will be allowed in the bottle.The bottles are placed in an incubator and kept atbody temperature. They are watched daily for signs ofgrowth, including cloudiness or a color change in thebroth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there isevidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain anda subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of blood isremoved from the bottle and placed on a microscopeslide. The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained withpurple and red stains and examined under the micro-scope. If bacteria are seen, the color of stain they pickedup (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan-gular), and their size provide valuable clues as to whattype of microorganism they are and what antibioticsmight work best. To do the subculture, a drop of blood isplaced on a culture plate, spread over the surface, andplaced in an incubator.If there is no immediate visible evidence of growthin the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by doinggram stains and subcultures. These steps are repeateddaily for the first several days and periodically after that.When bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies itusing biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivitytesting, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is alsodone. The bacteria are tested against many differentantibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it.All information is passed on to the physician as soonas it is known. An early report, known as a preliminaryreport, is usually available after one day. This report willtell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, theresults of the gram stain. The next preliminary report mayinclude a description of the bacteria growing on the sub-culture. The laboratory notifies the physician immediatelywhen an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity testsare complete. Sensitivity tests may be complete before thebacteria is completely identified. The final report may notbe available for five to seven days. If bacteria was found,the report will include its complete identification and alist of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive.One automated system is considered one of the mostimportant recent technical advances in blood cultures. Itis called continuous-monitoring blood culture systems(CMCCS). The instruments automatically monitor thebottles containing the patient blood for evidence ofmicroorganisms, usually every 10 minutes. Many datapoints are collected daily for each bottle, and fed into acomputer for analysis. Sophisticated mathematical calcu-lations can determine when microorganisms have grown.This, combined with more frequent blood tests, make it
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 523Blood cultureGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 523possible to detect microbial growth earlier. In addition,all CMBCS instruments have the detection system, incu-bator, and agitation unit in one unit.
Preparation
Ten ml (milliliter) of blood is usually needed foreach blood culture bottle. First a healthcare workerlocates a vein in the inner elbow region. The area of skinwhere the blood will be drawn must be disinfected toprevent any microorganisms on a person’s skin fromentering the blood culture bottle and contaminating it.The area is disinfected by wiping the area with alcohol ina circular fashion, starting with tiny circles at the spotwhere the needle will puncture the skin and enlarging thesize of the circles while wiping away from the puncturesite. The same pattern of wiping is repeated using aniodine or iodophor solution. The top of the bottle is disin-fected using alcohol. After the person’s skin has beendisinfected, the healthcare worker draws the blood andabout 10 ml of blood is injected into each blood culturebottle. The type of bottles used will vary based onwhether the physician is looking for bacteria (aerobes oranaerobes), yeast, mold, or viruses.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncturesite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results will be negative. A single negativeculture does not rule out a blood infection. False nega-tives can occur if the person was started on antibioticsbefore the blood was drawn, if the environment forKEY TERMS

Abnormal results
The physician’s skill in interpreting the cultureresults and assessing the person’s clinical condition isessential in distinguishing a blood culture that is positivebecause of a true infection from a culture that is positivebecause it became contaminated. In true bacteremia, thepatient’s clinical condition should be consistent with ablood infection caused by the microorganism that wasfound. The microorganism is usually found in more thanone culture, it usually grows soon after the bottles areincubated, and it is often the cause of an infection some-where else in the person’s body.When the culture is positive because of contamina-tion, the patient’s clinical condition usually is not consis-tent with an infection from the identified microorganism.In addition, the microorganism is often one commonlyfound on skin, it rarely causes infection, it is found inonly one bottle, and it may appear after several days ofincubation. More than one microorganism often grow incontaminated cultures.Resources

Blood donation and registry
Definition
Blood donation refers to the process of collecting,testing, preparing, and storing blood and blood compo-nents. Donors are most commonly unpaid volunteers, butthey may also be paid by commercial enterprises. Blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 524Blood donation and registryGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 524registry refers to the collection and sharing of data aboutdonated blood and ineligible donors.
Purpose
The purpose of the blood collection and distributionsystem is to help ensure an adequate supply of blood foraccident victims, people needing surgery, and people suffer-ing from certain diseases, as well as for medical research.Sometimes, donors give blood specifically to benefita particular person. People preparing for elective surgerymay donate their own blood to be held and then returnedto them during surgery. This is known as autologousblood donation. Directed donor blood has been donatedby someone known to the intended recipient, such as afamily member or friend.Each year, more than four million Americans receiveblood transfusions involving more than 26 million unitsof blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about onepint), or an average of about 32,000 units per day. All ofthat blood must be collected, tested, prepared, stored, anddelivered to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight millionpeople in the United States donate blood each year; abouthalf of the total amount needed is provided by the 36regional blood centers of the American Red Cross.Whole blood and the various blood components havemany uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen, are usedto treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in controllingbleeding, are commonly used in the treatment ofleukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen plasma is alsoused to control bleeding in people deficient in certainclotting factors. Cryoprecipitated AHF, made from freshfrozen plasma, contains a few specific clotting factors.
Precautions
To ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi-tiered process of donor screening and deferral isemployed. This involves donor education, taking adetailed health history of each prospective donor, andgiving potential donors a simple physical examination(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test foranemia). At any point in the process, a potential donormay be “deferred,” or judged ineligible to donate blood.This deferral may be temporary or permanent, dependingon the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged to“self-defer,” or voluntarily decline to donate, rather thanput future blood recipients at risk.All donated blood is extensively tested before beingused. The first step is determining the blood type, whichindicates who can receive the blood. Receiving the wrongtype of blood can cause death. Blood is also screened forany antibodies that could cause complications for recipi-ents. In addition, blood is tested to screen out donorsinfected with the following diseases:Hepatitis Bsurface antigen ADD, hepatitis B core antibody,hepatitis Cvirus antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24 antigen,HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and syphilis. Nucleic Acid Amplification testing is also performed, and othertests may be done if a doctor requests them.In order to detect the greatest possible number ofinfections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive.For this reason, however, donors sometimes receive falsepositive test results. In these cases, more specific confir-matory tests are performed, to help rule out false positiveresults. Blood found to be abnormal is discarded, and allitems coming into direct contact with donors are usedonly once and then discarded. Donors of infected bloodare entered into the Donor Deferral Register, a confiden-tial national data base used to prevent deferred peoplefrom donating blood.In general, blood donors must be at least 17 yearsold (some states allow younger people to donate bloodwith their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110pounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.Many factors can temporarily or permanently dis-qualify potential donors. Most of them have to do withhaving engaged in behaviors that put them at risk ofinfection or having spent time in certain specified areas.Among these factors are having had a tattoo, having hadsex with people in high-risk groups, having had certaindiseases, and having been raped.Description
There are eight different blood types in all—fourABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive orRh negative. These types, and their approximate distribu-tion in the U.S. population, are as follows: O+ (38%), O-(7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%), B- (2%), AB+ (3%),AB- (1%). In an emergency, anyone can safely receivetype O red blood cells, and people with this blood type areknown as “universal donors. “ People with type AB blood,known as “universal recipients,” can receive any type ofred blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types.Blood donations can be made in community bloodcenters, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which visitschools, churches and workplaces. The actual process ofdonating whole blood takes about 20 minutes. A sterileneedle is inserted into a vein in the donor’s arm. Theblood flows through plastic tubing into a blood bag.Donors may be asked to clench their fist to encourageblood to flow. Usually, one unit of blood is collected.Afterward, donors are escorted to an observation area,given light refreshments, and allowed to rest.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 525Blood donation and registryGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 525Plasma, the liquid portion of the blood in which redblood cells, platelets and other elements are suspended, isalso collected, often by commercial enterprises that sell itto companies manufacturing clotting factors and otherblood products. This is done using a process known asapheresis, in which whole blood is collected, the desiredblood component is removed, and the remainder is returnedto the donor. Collecting plasma generally takes one to twohours. Apheresis may also be used to collect other bloodcomponents, such as platelets and granulocytes.
Preparation
Once whole blood has been collected, it is sent to a labfor testing and processing. Most donated blood is separatedinto its constituent components, such as red blood cells,platelets, and cryoprecipitate. This enables more than oneperson to benefit from the same unit of donated blood.Different blood components vary in how long theycan be stored. Red blood cells can be refrigerated for upto 42 days or frozen for as much as 10 years. Platelets,stored at room temperature, may be kept for up to fivedays. Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF canbe kept for as much as one year.
Aftercare
It generally takes about 24 hours for the donor’sbody to replenish the lost fluid. Replacing the lost redblood cells, however, may take as much as two months.Whole blood donors must wait a minimum of eightweeks before donating again. Some states place furtherlimits on the frequency and/or total number of times anindividual may donate blood within a 12-month period.
Risks
Thanks to the use of a multi-tiered screening sys-tem and advances in the effectiveness of screening tests,KEY TERMS

Nonetheless, there isstill a minuscule risk that blood recipients could con-tract HIV , Hepatitis C, or other infections via transfu-sion. Other diseases that could conceivably be contract-ed in this way, or that are of particular concern toblood-collection agencies, include babesiosis, Chagas disease, HTLV-I and -II,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cytomegalovirus,Lyme disease,malaria, and newvariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Autologous blood donors run a tiny risk of havingthe wrong blood returned to them due to clerical error.There is also a faint possibility of bacterial contamina-tion of the autologous blood.
Normal results
For most donors, the process is quick and painlessand they leave feeling fine. They may also find satisfac-tion in knowing that they have contributed to the nation’sblood supply and may even have helped save lives.
Abnormal results
Most blood donors suffer no significant aftereffects.Occasionally, however, donors feel faint or dizzy, nau-seous, and/or have pain, redness, or a bruise where theblood was taken. More serious complications, whichrarely occur, include fainting, muscle spasms, and nervedamage.Resources

Definition
Blood gas analysis, also called arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis, is a test which measures the amounts ofoxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as theacidity (pH) of the blood.
Purpose
An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively thelungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how effi-ciently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from it. Thetest also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys areinteracting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal-ance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi-ratory disease and other conditions that may affect thelungs, and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy(respiratory therapy). In addition, the acid-base compo-nent of the test provides information on kidney function.
Description
Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from anartery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen andcarbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content,oxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH.Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues throughthe bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygencan actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much dis-solves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (thepressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries).Therefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu-ally measuring how much oxygen the lungs are deliver-ing to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released into theblood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The partialcarbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs areeliminating this carbon dioxide.The remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in theblood combines with hemoglobin, a protein—iron com-pound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen contentmeasurement in an ABG analysis indicates how muchoxygen is combined with the hemoglobin. A relatedvalue is the oxygen saturation, which compares theamount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin tothe total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capa-ble of combining with.Carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the bloodthan oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate andsmaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in nor-mal amounts, the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonatecreates an acid-base balance in the blood, helping to keep
the pH at a level where the body’s cellular functions aremost efficient. The lungs and kidneys both participate inmaintaining the carbonic acid-bicarbonate balance. Thelungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys reg-ulate the bicarbonate. If either organ is not functioningproperly, an acid-base imbalance can result. Determina-tion of bicarbonate and pH levels, then, aids in diagnos-ing the cause of abnormal blood gas values.The procedureThe blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture (usu-ally in the wrist, although it could be in the groin or arm) orfrom an arterial line already in place. If a puncture is need-ed, the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic. Atechnician then collects the blood with a small sterile needleattached to a disposable syringe. The patient may feel abrief throbbing or cramping at the site of the puncture. Afterthe blood is drawn, the sample must be transported to thelaboratory as soon as possible for analysis.

There are no special preparations. Patients have norestrictions on drinking or eating before the test. If thepatient is receiving oxygen, the oxygen concentrationmust remain the same for 20 minutes before the test; ifthe test is to be taken without oxygen, the gas must beturned off for 20 minutes before the test is taken. Thepatient should breathe normally during the test.
Aftercare
After the blood has been taken, the technician or thepatient applies pressure to the puncture site for 10–15minutes to stop the bleeding, and then places a dressingover the puncture.The patient should rest quietly whileapplying the pressure to the puncture site. Health careworkers will observe the patient for signs of bleeding orcirculation problems
Risks
Risks are very low when the test is done correctly.Risks include bleeding or bruising at the site, or delayedbleeding from the site. Very rarely, there may be a prob-lem with circulation in the puncture area.
Normal results
Normal blood gas values are as follows:• partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
2): 75–100 mm Hg• partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO
2): 35–45 mmHg• oxygen content (O
2CT): 15–23%• oxygen saturation (SaO
2): 94–100%• bicarbonate (HCO
3): 22–26 mEq/liter• pH: 7.35–7.45KEY TERMS

Nor-mal blood pH ranges from 7.35–7.45.Abnormal results
Values that differ from those listed above may indi-cate respiratory, metabolic, or kidney disease. Theseresults also may be abnormal if the patient has experi-enced trauma that may affect breathing (especially headand neck injuries).

Blood sugar tests
Definition
Blood sugar tests include several different tests thatmeasure the amount of sugar (glucose) in a person’sblood. These tests are done either on an empty stomach,or after consuming a meal or premeasured glucose drink.Blood sugar tests are done primarily to diagnose andevaluate a person with diabetes mellitus.
Purpose
The body uses sugar, also called glucose, to supplythe energy it needs to function. People get sugar fromtheir diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made bythe pancreas and affects the outer membrane of cells,making it easy for glucose to move from the blood intothe cells. When insulin is active, blood glucose levels fall.Sugar from body tissues is stored in the form of glycogen.When glycogen is active, blood glucose levels rise.After a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply. Thepancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to takecare of all the newly added sugar found in the body. Theinsulin moves the sugar out of the blood and into thecells. Only then does the blood sugar start to level off and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 528Blood sugar testsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 528begin to fall. A person with diabetes mellitus either doesnot make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does notwork properly. The result is blood sugar that remainshigh, a condition called hyperglycemia.Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. Ifleft untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes,kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other bodyorgans. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, may also bediscovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia iscaused by various hormone disorders and liver disease,as well as by too much insulin.
Description
There are a variety of ways to measure a person’sblood sugar.Whole blood glucose testWhole blood glucose testing can be performed by aperson in his or her home, and kits are available for thispurpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a fingerstick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A singledrop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrumentcalled a glucometer. The glucometer quickly determinesthe blood sugar and shows the results on a small screenin usually a few seconds.Fasting plasma glucose testThe fasting plasma glucose test is done on an emptystomach. For the eight hours before the test, the personmust fast (nothing to eat or drink, except water). The per-son’s blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare worker.The blood sample is collected into a tube containing ananticoagulant. Anticoagulants stop the blood from clot-ting. In the laboratory, the tube of blood spins at highspeed within a machine called a centrifuge. The bloodcells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the top.This straw-colored liquid on the top is the plasma. Tomeasure the glucose, a person’s plasma is combined withother substances. From the resulting reaction, the amountof glucose in the plasma is determined.Oral glucose tolerance testThe oral glucose tolerance test is done to see howwell the body handles a standard amount of glucose. Thistest measures the amount of glucose in a person’s plasmabefore and two hours after drinking a large premeasuredbeverage containing glucose. The person must eat a con-sistent diet, containing at least 5.25oz (150 g) of carbohy-drates each day, for three days before this test. For eighthours before the test, the person must fast. A healthcareprovider draws the first sample of blood at the end of thefast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test.The healthcare provider then gives the person a beveragecontaining 2.6 oz (75 g) of glucose. Two hours later, theperson’s blood is drawn again. These blood samples arecentrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor canthen compare the before and after glucose levels to seehow well the body processed the sugar.Two-hour postprandial blood glucose testThe two-hour postprandial blood glucose test mea-sures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eatsa specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it isdifficult to control many factors associated with this test-ing method.Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa-tions including:• Testing people suspected for diabetes. The AmericanDiabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either afasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerancetest be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person alreadyhas symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test withoutfasting (called a casual plasma glucose test) may bedone. If the test result is abnormal, it must be confirmedwith another test performed on another day. The twotests can be different or they can be the same, but theymust be done on different days. If the second test is alsoabnormal, the person has diabetes. A two-hour post-prandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a testto use for the diagnosis of diabetes. A doctor may orderthis test, and follow it with the oral glucose tolerancetest or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results areabnormal.• Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs duringpregnancy(gestational diabetes) is dangerous forboth the mother and the baby. Women who may be atrisk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant.A woman is considered at risk if she is older than 25years, is not at her normal body weight, has a parent orsibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic group thathas a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics, Native Ameri-cans, Asians, African Americans). The blood sugar testto screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of theoral glucose tolerance test. Fasting is not required. Ifthe result is abnormal, a more complete test is done onanother day.• Testing healthy people. Healthy people without symp-toms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes whenthey are 45 years old and again every three years. Eitherthe fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance testis used for screening. People in high risk groups shouldbe tested before the age of 45 and tested more frequently.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 529Blood sugar testsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 529• Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes. TheADA recommends that a person with diabetes keep theamount of glucose in the blood at a normal level as muchas possible. This can be done by the diabetic person test-ing his or her own blood at home one or more times a day.
Preparation
Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a 5mL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight band(tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a vein inthe inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into thatvein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needleinto an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes onlya few minutes.When fasting is required, the person should havenothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hoursbefore the test and until the test or series of tests is com-pleted. The person should not smoke before or during thetesting period because this can temporarily increase theamount of glucose in the blood. Other factors that cancause inaccurate results are a change in diet before thetest, illness or surgery two weeks before the test, certaindrugs, and extended bed rest. The doctor may tell a per-son on insulin or taking pills for diabetes to stop themedication until after the test.
Aftercare
After the test or series of tests is completed (andwith the approval of his or her doctor), the person shouldeat, drink, and take any medications that were stoppedfor the test.The patient may feel discomfort when blood is drawnfrom a vein. Bruising may occur at the puncture site orthe person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.
Risks
If the person experiences any weakness,fainting, sweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting orduring the test, he or she should immediately tell the per-son giving the test.
Normal results
Normal results are:• fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dLFor the diabetic person, the ADA recommends an ongo-ing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to 120 mg/dL.Abnormal results
These abnormal results indicate diabetes and mustbe confirmed with repeat testing:• fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to 126mg/dL• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal to200 mg/dL• casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symptoms)less than or equal to 200 mg/dL• gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less thanor equal to 140 mg/dLBrain damage can occur from glucose levels below40 mg/dL and comafrom levels above 470 mg/dL.Other hormone disorders can cause both hyper-glycemia and hypoglycemia. Abnormal results must beinterpreted by a doctor who is aware of the person’s med-ical condition and medical history.Resources

Definition
Blood typing is a laboratory test done to determine aperson’s blood type. If the person needs a blood transfu- sion, another test called crossmatching is done after theblood is typed to find blood from a donor that the per-son’s body will accept.
Purpose
Blood typing and crossmatching are most common-ly done to make certain that a person who needs a trans-fusion will receive blood that matches (is compatiblewith) his own. People must receive blood of the sameblood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal, transfusionreaction can occur.Parents who are expecting a baby have their bloodtyped to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of thenewborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as ery- throblastosis fetalis. Babies who have a blood type dif-ferent from their mothers are at risk for developing thisdisease. The disease is serious with certain blood typedifferences, but is milder with others.A child inherits factors or genes from each parentthat determine his blood type. This fact makes blood typ-ing useful in paternity testing. To determine whether ornot the alleged father could be the true father, the bloodtypes of the child, mother, and alleged father are com-pared.Legal investigations may require typing of blood orother body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identifypersons involved in crimes or other legal matters.
Description
Blood typing and crossmatching tests are performedin a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained inblood bank and transfusion services. The tests are doneon blood, after it has separated into cells and serum(serum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clots.)Costs for both tests are covered by insurance when thetests are determined to be medically necessary.Blood bank laboratories are usually located in facili-ties, such as those operated by the American Red Cross,that collect, process, and supply blood that is donated, aswell as in facilities, such as most hospitals, that prepareblood for transfusion. These laboratories are regulated bythe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and are often inspected and accredited by a professionalassociation such as the American Association of BloodBanks (AABB).Blood typing and crossmatching tests are based onthe reaction between antigens and antibodies. An antigencan be anything that causes the body to launch an attack,known as an immune response, against it. The attackbegins when the body builds a special protein, called anantibody, that is uniquely designed to attack and makeineffective (neutralize) the specific antigen that causedthe attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make anti-bodies against its own antigens, only against antigensthat are foreign to it.A person’s body contains many antigens. The anti-gens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor-tant because they determine a person’s blood type. Whenred blood cells having a certain blood type antigen aremixed with serum containing antibodies against that anti-gen, the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen. In atest tube, this reaction is observed as the formation ofclumps of cells (clumping).When blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum aremixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared serumand cells. Clumping tells which antigens or antibodiesare present and reveals the person’s blood type. Whenblood is crossmatched, patient serum is mixed with cellsfrom donated blood that might be used for transfusion.Clumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tellswhether or not the blood is compatible.Although there are over 600 known red blood cellantigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routineblood typing and crossmatching is usually concernedwith only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood groupsystems.Blood typing
ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl Land-steiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined theserum and red blood cells of his colleagues. From thereactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered theABO blood group system. This discovery earned him the1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.A person’s ABO blood type—A, B, AB, or O—isbased on the presence or absence of the A and B antigenson his red blood cells. The A blood type has only the Aantigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen. TheAB blood type has both A and B antigens, and the Oblood type has neither A nor B antigen.By the time a person is six months old, he naturallywill have developed antibodies against the antigens hisred blood cells lack. That is, a person with A blood typewill have anti-B antibodies, and a person with B blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 531Blood typing and crossmatchingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 531type will have anti-A antibodies. A person with AB bloodtype will have neither antibody, but a person with Oblood type will have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.Although the distribution of each of the four ABO bloodtypes varies between racial groups, O is the most com-mon and AB is the least common.ABO typing is the first test done on blood when it istested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO-matched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the majorcause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens arealso found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility isalso important for organ transplants.An ABO incompatibility between a pregnant womanand her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causesno problem for the baby. The structure of ABO antibod-ies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attackthe baby’s red blood cells.Paternity testing compares the ABO blood types ofthe child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged fathercan’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires agene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, achild with blood type B whose mother has blood type O,requires a father with either AB or B blood type; a manwith blood type O cannot be the true father.In some people, ABO antigens can be found in bodyfluids other than blood, such as saliva and semen. ABOtyping of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations.
RH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,system was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner andWiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeysinto guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens havesince been discovered belonging to this system, makingit the most complex red blood cell antigen system.In routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,only one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also knownas the Rh factor or Rh
o[D], is tested for. If the D antigenis present, that person is Rh-positive; if the D antigen isabsent, that person is Rh-negative.Other important antigens in the Rh system are C, c,E, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in rou-tine blood typing tests. However, testing for the presenceof these antigens is useful in paternity testing, and whena technologist tries to identify unexpected Rh antibodies

Blood typing is a laboratory test done to discover a person’s blood type. If the person needs a blood transfusion, cross-matching is done following blood typing to locate donor blood that the person’s body will accept. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 532or find matching blood for a person with antibodies toone or more of these antigens.Unlike the ABO system, antibodies to Rh antigensdon’t develop naturally. They develop only as an immuneresponse after a transfusion or during pregnancy.The incidence of the Rh blood types varies betweenracial groups, but not as widely as the ABO blood types:85% of whites and 90% of blacks are Rh-positive; 15%of whites and 10% of blacks are Rh-negative.In transfusions, the Rh system is next in importanceafter the ABO system. Most Rh-negative people whoreceive Rh-positive blood will develop anti-D antibodies.A later transfusion of Rh-positive blood could result in asevere or fatal transfusion reaction.Rh incompatibility is the most common and severecause of HDN. This incompatibility can happen when anRh-negative woman and an Rh-positive man produce anRh-positive baby. Cells from the baby can cross the pla-centa and enter the mother’s bloodstream, causing themother to make anti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibod-ies, the structure of anti-D antibodies makes it likely thatthey will cross the placenta and enter the baby’s blood-stream. There, they can destroy the baby’s red bloodcells, causing severe or fatal anemia.The first step in preventing HDN is to find out the Rhtypes of the expectant parents. If the mother is Rh-negativeand the father is Rh-positive, the baby is at risk for devel-oping HDN. The next step is to test the mother’s serum tomake sure she doesn’t already have anti-D antibodies fromKEY TERMS
ABO blood type—Blood type based on the pres-ence or absence of the A and B antigens on the redblood cells.Antibody—A special protein made by the body as adefense against foreign material that enters the body.It is uniquely designed to attack and neutralize thespecific antigen that triggered the immune response.Antigen—Anything that causes the body to launchan immune response against that antigen throughthe production of antibodies.Blood bank—A laboratory that specializes in bloodtyping, antibody identification, and transfusion ser-vices.Blood type—Blood categories based on the pres-ence or absence of certain antigens on the redblood cells.Crossmatch—A laboratory test done to confirm thatblood from a donor and blood from the recipientare compatible.Gene—A piece of DNA, located on a chromosome,that determines how traits such as blood type areinherited and expressed.Immune response—The body’s attack against anantigen that it considers foreign to itself. The attackbegins with the production of antibodies against theantigen.Rh blood type—Blood type based on the presenceor absence of the D antigen on the red blood cells.Transfusion—The therapeutic introduction of bloodor a blood component into a patient’s bloodstream.a previous pregnancy or transfusion. This procedure issimilar to blood typing. Finally, the Rh-negative mother isgiven an injection of Rh Immunoglobulin (RhIg) at 28weeks of gestation and again after delivery, if the baby isRh positive. The RhIg attaches to any Rh-positive cellsfrom the baby in the mother’s bloodstream, preventingthem from triggering anti-D antibody production in themother. An Rh-negative woman should also receive RhIgfollowing a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy.
OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS. Several otherblood group systems may be involved in HDN and trans-fusion reactions, although they are much less frequentthan ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy, Kell, Kidd, MNS,and P systems. Tests for antigens from these systems arenot included in routine blood typing, but they are com-monly used in paternity testing.Like Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems donot develop naturally, but as an immune response aftertransfusion or during pregnancy. An antibody screeningtest is done before a crossmatch to check for unexpectedantibodies to antigens in these systems. A person’s serumis mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared cellscontaining antigens from these systems. If clumpingoccurs, the antibody is identified.CrossmatchingCrossmatching is the final step in pretransfusiontesting. It is commonly referred to as compatibility test-ing, or “Type and Cross.”
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 533Blood typing and crossmatchingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 533Before blood from a donor and the recipient arecrossmatched, both are ABO and Rh typed. In addition,antibody screening is done to look for antibodies to cer-tain Rh, Duffy, MNS, Kell, Kidd, and P system antigens.If an antibody to one of these antigens is found, onlyblood without that antigen will be compatible in a cross-match. This sequence must be repeated before eachtransfusion a person receives.To begin the crossmatch, blood from a donor withthe same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected. Ina test tube, serum from the patient is mixed with redblood cells from the donor. If clumping occurs, the bloodis not compatible; if clumping does not occur, the bloodis compatible. If an unexpected antibody is found ineither the patient or the donor, the blood bank does fur-ther testing to make sure the blood is compatible.In an emergency, when there is not enough time forblood typing and crossmatching, O red blood cells maybe given, preferably Rh-negative. O blood type is calledthe universal donor because it has no ABO antigens for apatient’s antibodies to attack. In contrast, AB blood typeis called the universal recipient because it has no ABOantibodies to attack the antigens on transfused red bloodcells. If there is time for blood typing, red blood cells ofthe recipient type (type specific cells) are given. In eithercase, the crossmatch is continued, even though the trans-fusion has begun.
Preparation
To collect the 10 mL blood needed for these tests, ahealthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the patient’selbow, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, andinserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws theblood through the needle into an attached tube. Collec-tion of the sample takes only a few minutes.Blood typing and crossmatching must be done threedays or less before a transfusion. A person doesn’t need tochange diet, medications, or activities before these tests.He should tell his healthcare provider if, during the lastthree months, he has received a blood transfusion or aplasma substitute, or has had a radiology procedure usingintravenous contrast media. These can give false clump-ing reactions in both typing and crossmatching tests.
Aftercare
The possible side effects of any blood collection arediscomfort or bruising at the site where the needle punc-tured the skin, as well as dizzinessor fainting. Bruising is reduced if pressure is applied with a finger to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops. Discomfort is treatedwith warm packs to the puncture site.Risks
There are no risks from the blood collection or testprocedures. Blood transfusions always have the risk of anunexpected transfusion reaction. A nurse watches a patientfor signs of a reaction during the entire transfusion.
Normal results
There is no normal blood type. The desired result of acrossmatch is that compatible donor blood is found. Com-patibility testing procedures are designed to provide thesafest blood product possible for the recipient, but a com-patible crossmatch is no guarantee that an unexpectedadverse reaction will not appear during the transfusion.
Abnormal results
Except in an emergency, a person cannot receive atransfusion without a compatible crossmatch result.Resources

Definition
The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures thelevel of urea nitrogen in a sample of the patient’s blood.Urea is a substance that is formed in the liver when thebody breaks down protein. Urea then circulates in theblood in the form of urea nitrogen. In healthy people,most urea nitrogen is filtered out by the kidneys andleaves the body in the urine. If the patient’s kidneys arenot functioning properly or if the body is using largeamounts of protein, the BUN level will rise. If the patienthas severe liver disease, the BUN will drop.
Purpose
The BUN level may be checked in order to assess ormonitor:• the presence or progression of kidney or liver disease.• blockage of urine flow.• mental confusion. Patients with kidney failure aresometimes disoriented and confused.• abnormal loss of water from the body (dehydration). • recovery from severe burns. The body uses larger thannormal amounts of protein following serious burns.
Description
The BUN test is performed on a sample of thepatient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuumtube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,takes about five minutes.
Preparation
The doctor should check to make sure that thepatient is not taking any medications that can affect BUNresults. These drugs include the antibioticschloram- phenicol, streptomycin, amphotericin B, methicillin,gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin, as well asdiureticsand corticosteroids.The patient should be advised not to eat largeamounts of meat the day before the test.
Aftercare
Aftercare consists of routine care of the area aroundthe venipuncture.
Risks
The primary risk is the possibility of a bruise orswelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patient canapply moist warm compresses.KEY TERMS
Urea—A compound containing nitrogen thatoccurs in the urine and other body fluids as aresult of protein metabolism.
Normal results
Normal BUN levels are 5-18 mg/dL for children; 7-18 mg/dL for adults; and 8-20 mg/dL in the elderly.
Abnormal results
BUN levels can be too low as well as too high.Abnormally low BUNLow levels of BUN may indicate overhydration, malnutrition,celiac disease[a disease characterized bythe inability ot tolerate foods containing wheat protein(gluten)], liver damage or disease, or use of corticos-teroids. Low BUN may also occur in early pregnancy. Abnormally high BUNHigh levels of BUN may indicate kidney disease orfailure; blockage of the urinary tract by a kidney stone ortumor; a heart attackor congestive heart failure; dehy- dration; fever; shock; or bleeding in the digestive tract.High BUN levels can sometimes occur during late preg-nancy or result from eating large amounts of protein-richfoods. A BUN level higher than 100 mg/dL points tosevere kidney damage.Resources

Definition
Boils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hairfollicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (smallblister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle.Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle isformed when several furuncles merge to form a singledeep abscesswith several heads or drainage points.
Description
Boils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about0.2-0.4 in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised abovethe skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A boil usuallyhas a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle is larger andhas several visible heads. Boils occur most commonly onthe face, back of the neck, buttocks, upper legs and groinarea, armpits, and upper torso. Carbuncles are less commonthan single boils; they are most likely to form at the back ofthe neck. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles.Boils and carbuncles are common problems in thegeneral population, particularly among adolescents andadults. People who are more likely to develop these skininfections include those with:• diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin• alcoholism or drug abuse• poor personal hygiene• crowded living arrangements• jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub-stances, especially petroleum products• allergies or immune system disorders, including HIVinfection.• family members with recurrent skin infections
Causes and symptoms
Boils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcusaureus, a bacterium that causes an infection in an oilgland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human skinis usually resistant to bacterial infection,S. aureuscan enter through a break in the skin surface—includingbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or druginjections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasycreams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are morevulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can bespread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close humancontact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.As the infection develops, an area of inflamed tissuegradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that ispainful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a yellowishhead or point. It may either continue to swell until thepoint bursts open and allows the pus to drain, or it maybe gradually reabsorbed into the skin. It takes betweenone and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after itcomes to a head and discharges pus. The bacteria thatcause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin oreven into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil isinjured by squeezing. If the infection spreads, the patientwill usually develop chills and fever, swollen lymphnodes (lymphadenitis), and red lines in the skin runningoutward from the boil.Furunculosis is a word that is sometimes used torefer to recurrent boils. Many patients have repeatedepisodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat becausetheir nasal passages carry colonies of S. aureus. These bacterial colonies make it easy for the patient’s skin to bereinfected. They are most likely to develop in patientswith diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune systemdisorders.Carbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev-eral hair follicles that are close together. Carbunculosis isa word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop-ment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until theymerge with each other to form a single large area ofinfected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients withcarbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen-erally unwell.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usuallymade by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis ofvisual examination of the skin. In some cases involvingrecurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need to con-sider acneas a possible diagnosis, but for the most part
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 536BoilsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 536boils and carbuncles are not difficult to distinguish fromother skin disorders.S. aureuscan easily be cultured in the laboratory ifthe doctor needs to rule out inclusion cysts or deep fun-gal infections that gardeners sometimes get. The doctorcan make a culture from pus taken from the boil or car-buncle to confirm the diagnosis of a staphylococcalinfection. He or she can also culture the patient’s nasaldischarge to test for the presence of a S. aureuscolony.
Treatment
Patient and family educationPatient education is an important part of the treatmentof boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned againstpicking at or squeezing boils because of the danger ofspreading the infection into other parts of the skin orbloodstream. It is especially important to avoid squeezingboils around the mouth or nose because infections in theseareas can be carried to the brain. Patients should also beadvised about keeping the skin clean, washing their handscarefully before and after touching the boil or carbuncle,avoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keep-ing their towels and washcloths separate from those ofother family members. Some doctors may recommend anantiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected areas.If the patient has had several episodes of furunculo-sis, the doctor may examine family members or closecontacts to see if they are carriers of S. aureus. In many cases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles.Skin infections and reinfections involving small groupsor clusters of people are being reported more frequentlyin the United States.MedicationsBoils are usually treated with application of antibiot-ic creams—usually clindamycin or polymyxin—follow-ing the application of hot compresses. The compresseshelp the infection to come to a head and drain.Carbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated withoral antibioticsas well as antibiotic creams or oint-ments. The specific medications that are given are usual-ly dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin (Keflex). Ery-thromycin may be given to patients who are allergic topenicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10days; however, patients with recurrent furunculosis maybe given oral antibiotics for longer periods. Furunculosisis treated with a combination of dicloxacillin andrifampin (Rifadin).Patients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas-sages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to applydirectly to the lining of the nose.Surgical treatmentBoils and carbuncles that are very large, or that arenot draining, may be opened with a sterile needle or sur-gical knife to allow the pus to drain. The doctor will usu-ally give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife is used;surgical treatment of boils is painful and usually leavesnoticeable scars.
Alternative treatment
Naturopathic therapyNaturopathic practitioners usually recommendchanges in the patient’s diet as well as applying herbalpoultices to the infected area. The addition of zinc sup-plements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to beeffective in treating boils. The application of a paste orpoultice containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) root is recommended by naturopaths on the groundsthat goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduceinflammation.HomeopathyHomeopaths maintain that taking the proper homeo-pathic medication in the first stages of a boil or carbunclewill bring about early resolution of the infection and pre-vent pus formation. The most likely choices are Bel- ladonnaor Hepar sulphuris.

Prognosis
The prognosis for most boils is excellent. Somepatients, however, suffer from recurrent carbuncles orfurunculosis. In addition, although the spread of infec-tion from boils is relatively unusual, there have beendeaths reported from brain infections caused by squeez-ing boils on the upper lip or in the tissue folds at thebase of the nose.
Prevention
There are some precautions that people can take tominimize the risk of developing bacterial skin infections:• cleanse skin properly with soap and water, and takeshowers rather than tub baths• do not share washcloths, towels, or facial cosmeticswith others• cut down on greasy or fatty foods and snacks• always wash hands before touching the face• consider using antiseptic soaps and shower gels• consult a doctor if furunculosis is a persistent prob-lem—it may indicate an underlying disease such asdiabetesResourcesBOOKS

Bone biopsy
Definition
Bone biopsy is the removal of a piece of bone forlaboratory examination and analysis.
Purpose
Bone biopsy is used to distinguish between malig-nant tumors and benign bone disease such as osteoporo-sisand osteomyelitis. This test may be ordered to deter-mine why a patient’s bones ache or feel sore, or when amass or deformity is found on an x ray, CT scan, bonescan, or other diagnostic imaging procedure.
Precautions
The patient’s doctor and the surgeon who performsthe bone biopsy must be told about any prescription andover-the-counter medications the patient is taking, andabout allergiesor reactions the patient has had to anes-thetics or painrelievers. Special care must be taken withpatients who have experienced bleeding problems.
Description
A bone biopsy involves using a special drill or othersurgical instruments to remove bone from the patient’sbody. The procedure usually lasts about 30 minutes andmay be performed in the hospital, a doctor’s office, or asurgical center.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 538Bone biopsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 538A drill biopsy is generally used to obtain a smallspecimen. After the skin covering the bone has beencleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient isgiven a local anesthetic. The doctor will not begin theprocedure until the anesthetic has numbed the area fromwhich the bone is to be removed, but the patient may feelpressure or mild pain when the needle pierces the bone.The surgeon turns the needle in a half-circle to extract asample from the core, or innermost part, of the bone. Thesample is drawn into the hollow stem of the biopsy nee-dle. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it isexamined under a microscope.An open biopsy is used when a larger specimen isneeded. After the area covering the bone has beencleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient isgiven a general anesthetic. After the anesthetic takeseffect and the patient is unconscious, the surgeon makesan incision and removes a bone specimen. The specimenis sent to the laboratory for immediate analysis. Resultsof that analysis may indicate that additional surgeryshould be performed right away.
Preparation
No special preparation is needed for a drill biopsy,but a patient must fast for at least 12 hours before anopen biopsy.
Aftercare
Pain medication will be prescribed after a biopsy,and vital signs will be monitored until they return to nor-mal. Most patients can go home in about an hour. If bonewas removed from the spine, the patient may stay in thehospital overnight. The surgical site must be kept cleanand dry for 48 hours, and the patient’s doctor should benotified if any of these symptoms appear:•f e v e r• headache• pain on movement• inflammation or pus near the biopsy site• bleeding through the bandage at the biopsy site
Risks
Risks include bone fracture, injury to nearby tissue,and infection. Bleeding is a rare complication. Factorsthat increase risk include:• stress• obesity• poor nutritionKEY TERMS
Biopsy—Removal and examination of tissue todetermine if cancer is present.Osteomyelitis—An infection of the bone that isusually treated with antibiotics but sometimesrequires surgery.Osteoporosis—Thinning and loss of bone tissue.• chronic illness• some medications• mind-altering drugs
Normal results
Normal bone is made up of collagen fibers and bonetissue.
Abnormal results
Bone biopsy can reveal the presence of benign dis-ease, infection, or malignant tumors that have spread tothe bone from other parts of the body.Results of this test are considered reliable, but maybe affected by:• failure to fast before open biopsy• failure to obtain an adequate specimen• delayed microscopic examination or laboratory analysisResources

Bone density test
Definition
A bone density test, or scan, is designed to check forosteoporosis, a disease that occurs when the bonesbecome thin and weak. Osteoporosis happens when thebones lose calcium and other mineralsthat keep themstrong. Osteoporosis begins after menopausein many women, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in seri-ous fractures. These fractures may not only bring dis-ability, but may affect longevity. As many as one-fourthof women who fracture their hip after age 50 die withinone year.Most people today will get a bone density scan froma machine using a technology called Dual Energy X-rayAbsorptiometry or DEXA for short. This machine takes apicture of the bones in the spine, hip, total body andwrist, and calculates their density. If a DEXA machine isnot available, bone density scans can also be done withdual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hipand total body) and quantitative computed tomographyscans(measuring the spine). Bone density scanners thatuse DEXA technology to just measure bone density inthe wrist (called pDEXA scans) provide scans at somedrugstores. Yet these tests are not as accurate as thosethat measure density in the total body, spine or hip—where most fractures occur.Purpose
A bone density scan measures the strength of anindividual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture. Anobservation of any osteoporosis present can be made.
Description
To take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient lies ona bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic arm thatemits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a fan beam thatrotates around the patient. During the test, the scannermoves to capture images of the patient’s spine, hip or entirebody. A computer then compares the patient’s bonestrength and risk of fracture to that of other people in theUnited States at the same age and to young people at peakbone density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and thenstart to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to do andis painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about $250. Someinsurance companies and Medicare cover the cost. pDEXAwrist bone scans in drugstores are available for about $30.
Preparation
The patient puts on a hospital gown and lies on thebed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors routinelyschedule this test. If the following factors apply to apatient, they may need a bone density scan and can dis-cuss this with their doctor. The patient:• is at risk for osteoporosis• is near menopause• has broken a bone after a modest trauma• has a family history of osteoporosis• uses steroid or antiseizure medications

Risks
The DEXA bone scan exposes the patient to only asmall amount of radiation—about one-fiftieth that of achest x ray, or about the amount you get from taking across-country airplane flight.
Normal results
The patient, when compared with people at “youngnormal bone density” (called the T-score) has the same ordenser bones than a healthy 30-year-old. T scores above1 mean that a patient has a healthy bone mass. Scoresfrom 0 to /H110021 mean that the patient has borderline bonemass and should repeat the test in two to five years.
Abnormal results
The patient has two to four times the risk of a brokenbone as other people in the United States at the same ageand those at peak bone density. If a patient’s T scoreKEY TERMS

Bone disorder drugs
Definition
Bone disorder drugs are medicines used to treat dis-eases that weaken the bones.

The drugs described here are used to treat or preventosteoporosis(brittle bone disease) in women pastmenopauseas well as older men. They also are used pre-scribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that weak-ens and deforms bones, and they are used to control calci-um levels in the blood.Bone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is con-stantly being broken down and replaced with new materi-al. Normally, there is a balance between the breakdownof old bone and its replacement with new bone. Butwhen something goes wrong with the process, bone dis-orders may result.Osteoporosis is a particular concern for womenafter menopause, as well as for older men. In osteo-porosis, the inside of the bones become porous and thin.Over time, this condition weakens the bones and makesthem more likely to break. Osteoporosis is four timesmore common in women than in men. This is becausewomen have less bone mass than men, tend to livelonger and take in less calcium, and need the femalehormone estrogen to keep their bones strong. If menlive long enough, they are also at risk of getting osteo-porosis later in life. Once total bone mass has peaked—around age 35—all adults start to lose it. In women, therate of bone loss speeds up during menopause, whenestrogen levels fall. Bone loss may also occur if bothovaries are removed by surgery. Ovaries make estrogen.Hormone replacement therapyis one approach topreventing osteoporosis. However, not all people canuse hormone replacement therapy. Bone disorder drugsare a good alternative for people who already haveosteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it. Riskfactors include lack of regular exercise, early menopause, being underweight, and a strong familyhistory of osteoporosis.
Description
Bone disorder drugs are available only with aphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasalspray, and injectable forms. Commonly used bone dis-order drugs are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin(Miacalcin, Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Ralox-ifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selectiveestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act likeestrogen in some parts of the body but not in others.This makes the drugs less likely to cause some of theharmful effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estro-gen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast cancer. In fact, research suggests that raloxifene mayeven reduce that risk.Recommended dosage
Alendronate
FOR OSTEOPOROSIS. The usual dose is 10 mg oncea day. Treatment usually continues over many years.
FOR PAGET’S DISEASE. The usual dose is 40 mg oncea day for six months.This medicine works only when it is taken with a fullglass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30 min-utes before eating or drinking anything or taking anyother medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutesafter taking it because the drug can irritate the esophagus,the tube that delivers food form the mouth to the stomach.Calcitonin
NASAL SPRAY. The usual dose is one spray into thenose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the rightnostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.
INJECTABLE. The recommended dosage depends onthe condition for which the medicine is prescribed andmay be different for different people. Check with thephysician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription for the proper dosage.RaloxifeneThe usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.
Precautions
AldendronatePeople with low levels of calcium in their bloodshould not take this medicine. It also is not recommendedfor women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyonewith kidney problems. Before using alendronate, anyonewho has digestive or swallowing problems should makesure that his or her physician knows about the condition.CalcitoninCalcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or smallsores in the nose. Check with a physician if this becomesvery uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose.The injectable form of calcitonin has caused seriousallergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray is notknown to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists.Before starting treatment with calcitonin, the physicianwho prescribes the drug may order an allergy test tomake sure there will not be a problem.RaloxifeneA rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is anincreased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 542Bone disorder drugsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 542may break away and travel to the lungs. This is about aslikely in women who take raloxifene as it is in womenwho take estrogen. Because of this possible problem,women with a history of blood clots in their veins shouldnot take raloxifene.Women who have had breast canceror cancer of theuterus should check with their physicians about whetherthey can safely use raloxifene.General precautions for bone disorder drugsTo keep bones strong, the body needs calcium andvitamin D. Dairy products and fish such as salmon, sar-dines and tuna are good sources of both calcium and vita-min D. People who are taking bone disorder drugs forosteoporosis and who do not get enough of these nutri-ents in their dietsshould check with their physiciansabout taking supplements. Other important bone-savingsteps are avoiding smokingand alcohol and gettingenough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on thebones (such as walking or lifting weights).People who are taking these drugs because they havetoo much calcium in their blood may need to limitthe amount of calcium in their diets. Too much calcium may pre-vent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the properdiet with the physician who prescribed the drug, and do notmake any diet changes without the physician’s approval.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis-order drugs in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physician alsoshould be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preser-vatives, or other substances.Women who are pregnant or who may become preg-nant and women who are breastfeeding should checkwith their physicians before using this alendronate or cal-citonin. Raloxifene should not be used by women whoare pregnant or who may become pregnant. In laboratorystudies of rats, raloxifene caused birth defects.
Side effects
AldendronateCommon side effects include constipation,diar- rhea,indigestion, nausea,painin the abdomen, andpain in the muscles and bones. These problems usuallygo away as the body adjusts to the medicine and do notneed medical attention unless they continue or they inter-fere with normal activities.CalcitoninThe most common side effects of calcitonin nasalspray are nose problems, such as dryness, redness, itch-KEY TERMS

Bone grafting
Definition
Bone grafting is a surgical procedure by which newbone or a replacement material is placed into spacesbetween or around broken bone (fractures) or holes inbone (defects) to aid in healing.
Purpose
Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures thatare extremely complex, pose a significant risk to thepatient, or fail to heal properly. Bone graft is also used tohelp fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, orprovide structural support for fractures of the spine. Inaddition to fracture repair, bone graft is used to repairdefects in bone caused by birth defects, traumatic injury,or surgery for bone cancer.Description
Bone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up of aprotein called collagen. It is strengthened by deposits ofcalcium and phosphate salts, called hydroxyapatite.Within and around this matrix are located the cells of thebones, which are of four types. Osteoblasts produce thebone matrix. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serveto maintain the bone. Osteoclasts break down andremove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone sur-faces. Together, these four types of cells are responsiblefor building the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remod-eling the bone as needed.There are three ways in which a bone graft can helprepair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the for-mation of new bone by the cells contained within thegraft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical processin which molecules contained within the graft (bonemorphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s cells intocells that are capable of forming bone. The third is osteo-conduction, a physical effect by which the matrix of thegraft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient areable to form new bone.New bone for grafting can be obtained from otherbones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or ribs),called autograft, or from bone taken from other peoplethat is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft.A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materialsare also used instead of bone, including collagen (theprotein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone,and connective tissues); polymers, such as silicone andsome acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; andceramics. A new material, called resorbable polymericgrafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts pro-vide a structure for new bone to grow on; the grafts thenslowly dissolve, leaving only the new bone behind.To place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision inthe skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft orreplacement material to fit into the defect. After the graftis placed into the defect, it is held in place with pins,plates, or screws. The incision is closed with stitches anda splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the boneswhile healing.The costs associated with a bone graft vary. Thesecosts include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiolo-gist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospitalcharges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more forintensive care or private rooms); medication charges($200 to $400); and additional charges, including anassisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diagnosticprocedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical sup-plies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft itself canrange from $250 to $900.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 544Bone graftingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 544This procedure is covered by many third-party insur-ers; insurance coverage should be explored for each indi-vidual case.
Aftercare
The time required for convalescence for fractures orspinal fusion may vary from one to 10 days, and vigor-ous exercisemay be limited for up to three months.Most bone grafts are successful in helping the bonedefect to heal. The extent of recovery will depend on thesize of the defect and the condition of the bone sur-rounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe defectsmay take some time to heal and may require furtherattention after the initial graft. In one study of over1,000 patients who received very large allografts aftersurgery for bone cancer, researchers found that approxi-mately 85% of the patients were able to return to workor normal physical activities without using crutches.However, about 25% of these patients required a secondoperation, because the first did not heal properly. Lesssevere bone defects, though, should heal completelywithout serious complications.
Risks
The risks for any surgical procedure requiring anes-thesia include reactions to the medications and breathingproblems. The risks for any surgical procedure includebleeding and infection.The drawbacks of autografts include: the additionalsurgical and anesthesia time (typically 30 minutes perprocedure) to obtain, or harvest, the bone for grafting;added costs of the additional surgery; painand infectionthat might occur at the site from which the graft is taken;and the relatively small amount of bone that is availablefor grafting.The drawbacks of allografts include: variabilitybetween lots, since the bone is harvested from a varietyof donors; the bone may take longer to incorporate withthe host bone than an autograft would; the graft may beless effective than an autograft; and the possibility oftransferring diseases to the patient. Other complicationsmay result from the immune response mounted by thepatient’s immune system against the grafted bone tissue.With the use anti-rejection agents (drugs to combatrejection of grafted bone tissue) immune rejection is lessof a problem.Resources

Bone growth stimulation
Definition
Bone growth stimulation is the technique of promot-ing bone growth in difficult to heal fracturesby apply- ing a low electrical current or ultrasound to the fracture.
Purpose
Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactoryhealing is not occurring naturally or when the pace ofhealing is too slow. This condition is called fracturenonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adultsthan children, in people with severe or complex fractures,and in people who smoke.The theory behind applying an electric current tofractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact thatthe concave side of the bone becomes negativelycharged and the convex side is positively charged. It isbelieved that artificially encouraging this charging withan electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) also approved theapplication of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treat-ment for fracture nonunion.Ultrasound and electromagnetic stimulation areexpensive and are used only when healing problems existfor a substantial length of time. Each method must beused for at least three to six months to be effective.
Precautions
Bone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gapbetween the ends of the fracture is too large.
Description
Electric stimulation can be applied either from theinside of the body (invasively) or from the outside thebody (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive pro-cedure. The type of stimulation selected depends on thedoctor’s preference, the type and location of the fracture,and the patient’s motivation to comply with the treat-ment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere from threeto six months.Invasive stimulatorsInvasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial-ly implantable. The advantage of these devices is that theyapply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours aday. The fully implantable stimulator requires little dailyattention from the patient. Patients using a semi-implantedstimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule andhave to care for the external power pack. The disadvantageof implantable and semi-implantable stimulators is thattheir implantation is a surgical procedure.Fully implantable direct current stimulators areinstalled in a hospital under general or regional anesthesia.Both the stimulator and the power source are implanted.The surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shapedcathode inside the bone. A wire leads to the power sourceand a small anode. The power source is a battery pack thatis implanted in the nearby muscle. The body transmitselectrical current to close the circuit. The incision is thenclosed. Once in place, the device provides continuousdirect electric current for bone growth stimulation.Partially implanted stimulators use cathode pins thatare implanted at the edge of each bone that is fractured.Wires lead to the surface of the skin where a powersource and the anode are located. Wires complete the cir-cuit. The external portion of the device is held in place bya cast. This source of stimulation also runs continuously.Noninvasive stimulatorsIn the noninvasive stimulator, external electromag-netic coils are placed on either side of the fracture andare held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the coilscorrectly is important, and their location relative to thefracture is usually confirmed by x rays.The coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field.It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatmentschedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation any-where from three to ten hours each day in periods of noless than one hour.Ultrasound stimulation is the most recent treatmentfor stimulating bone growth. A device that generates lowintensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over thefracture. The advantage of this technique is that it is non-invasive and the period of application of the sound pulsescan be as short as 20-30 minutes each day. The results ofthis treatment have been studied less than the effect ofelectromagnetic stimulation.
Preparation
Bone growth stimulation is done only when healinghas failed to occur for many months. Before it is started,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 546Bone growth stimulationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 546x rays are done of the fracture area. If the device is to beimplanted, standard preoperative blood and urine testsare done. The patient may meet with an anesthesiologistto discuss any conditions that might affect the adminis-tration of anesthesia.
Aftercare
If a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic fielddevice is used, the patient must not put any stressor weight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a matterof months in most cases. In all lower limb fractures,regardless of the stimulation method used, the patient cannot bear weight on the limb with the fracture until heal-ing is complete. This limits the patient’s mobility formany months. Patients have the responsibility for regu-larly making sure that the unit works and caring forexternal devices and the casts that hold them in place.
Risks
Noninvasive devices have few risks associated withthem. The main risk associated with implantable devicesis the development of infection at the site of implantation.
Normal results
Success in healing a fracture nonunion using bonegrowth stimulation depends on the type, location, andseverity of the fracture and the age and general health ofthe patient.Resources

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
Definition
Bone marrow aspiration, also called bone marrowsampling, is the removal by suction of fluid from thesoft, spongy material that lines the inside of most bones.Bone marrow biopsy, or needle biopsy, is the removal ofa small piece of bone marrow.KEY TERMS
Anode—The positive electrode to which an elec-tromagnetic current flows.Cathode—The negative electrode from which anelectromagnetic current flows.
Purpose
Bone marrow aspiration is used to:• pinpoint the cause of abnormal blood test results• confirm a diagnosis or check the status of severe ane-mia (abnormally low numbers of red blood cells in thebloodstream) of unknown cause, or other irregularitiesin the way blood cells are produced or become mature• evaluate abnormalities in the blood’s ability to storeiron• diagnose infectionBone marrow biopsy is used to:• obtain intact bone marrow for laboratory analysis• diagnose and stage some types of canceror anemia andother blood disorders• identify the source of an unexplained fever• diagnose fibrosis of bone marrow or myeloma (a tumorcomposed of cells normally found in the bone marrow)when bone marrow aspiration has failed to provide anappropriate specimenBone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsyare also used to gauge the effectiveness of chemothera-pyand other medical treatments. These procedures areoften used together to ensure the availability of the bestpossible bone marrow specimen.
Precautions
Allergiesor previous adverse reactions to medica-tions should be discussed with the doctor. Any currentmedications, including herbal or nutritional supplements,should be evaluated for the potential to interfere withproper coagulation (clot formation). These would includecoumadin,aspirin, and other agents used as blood thin-ners. Caution should be used when the herbs gingko, gin-ger, garlic, or ginseng have been utilized as supplements,due to a risk of bleeding.Pregnancy,lactation(production and secretion ofmilk), and preexisting platelet or bleeding disordersshould be evaluated before either procedure is undertaken.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 547Bone marrow aspiration GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 547Description
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be per-formed by a physician or nurse clinician. Each proce-dure takes about 20 to 30 minutes and is usually per-formed on an outpatient basis, but can be done in a hos-pital if necessary.The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with anantiseptic, and the patient may be given a mild sedative.A local anesthetic is administered. The hematologist ornurse clinician performing the procedure will not beginuntil the anesthetic has numbed the area from which thespecimen is to be extracted. In both adults and children,aspiration and biopsy are most commonly performed onthe rear bone of the hip (posterior iliac crest). In adults,sampling from the sternum (breastbone) is sometimesdone. The latter location is technically easier, but issomewhat more painful for the patient and presents therisk of heart injury. On rare occasions, a long bone of theleg (tibia) may be used as a sample site for an infant.In a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle isinserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetratesthe cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At least half ateaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from the bone by asyringe attached to the needle. The patient may experi-ence discomfort when the needle is inserted or when themarrow is aspirated. If more marrow is needed, the nee-dle is repositioned slightly, a new syringe is attached, anda second sample is taken. The samples are transferredfrom the syringes to slides and vials, then sent to a labo-ratory for analysis.Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immediatelybefore or after bone marrow aspiration. The procedure uti-lizes a special large-bore needle that is used to drill out acore of marrow. In bone marrow biopsy, the needle isinserted, rotated from side to side, withdrawn, and reinsert-ed at a different angle. This procedure is repeated if neededuntil a small core, about 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separat-ed from the bone marrow. The needle is again removed,and a piece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfersthe specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel dis-comfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and experi-ence a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow is with-drawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are smeared,these samples contain structurally intact bone marrow.Microscopic examination can show what material its cells

CortexAspiration needleInner spongy layerBone marrow
In a bone marrow aspiration, a needle is inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetrates the cortex, or outer coveringof the bone. A small amount of marrow is suctioned out of the bone by a syringe attached to the needle.

The bone may either be embedded intact in paraffin (atype of wax), or be decalcified (a process which takes placeovernight) for a different type of staining and examination.Each type of preparation has certain advantages.
Preparation
A current history and physical are obtained from thepatient, along with proper consent. The patient is gener-ally placed in a prone position (lying face down) forpreparation, and local anesthetic, with or without seda- tion, is administered.
Aftercare
After the needle is removed, the biopsy site will becovered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied tocontrol bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing, bloodpressure, and temperature are monitored until they returnto normal, and the patient may be instructed to remain ina supine position (lying face up) for half an hour beforegetting dressed.The patient should be able to leave the clinic andresume normal activities immediately. Patients who havereceived a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest of the day;driving, cooking, and other activities that require clearthinking and quick reactions should therefore be avoided.The biopsy site should be kept covered and dry forseveral hours. Walking or taking prescribed painmedica- tions usually ease any discomfort felt at the biopsy site,and ice can be used to reduce swelling.A doctor should be notified if the patient:• feels severe pain more than 24 hours after the procedure.• experiences persistent bleeding or notices more than afew drops of blood on the wound dressing.• has a temperature above 101°F (38.3°C). Inflammationand pus at the biopsy site and other signs of infectionshould also be reported to a doctor without delay
Risks
Bleeding and discomfort often occur at the biopsysite. Infection and hematoma may also develop. In rareinstances, the heart or a major blood vessel is piercedwhen marrow is extracted from the sternum during bonemarrow biopsy. This can lead to severe hemorrhage.
Normal results
Healthy adult bone marrow contains yellow fat cells,connective tissue, and red marrow that produces blood.KEY TERMS
Aspiration—A procedure to withdraw fluid fromthe body.Connective tissue—Material that links one part ofthe body with another.Fibrosis—A condition characterized by the pres-ence of scar tissue or fiber-containing tissues thatreplace normal tissues.Hematologist—A medical specialist who treatsdiseases and disorders of the blood and blood-forming organs.Hematoma—Blood that collects under the skinand causes swelling.Hemorrhage—Heavy bleeding.Myeloma—A tumor that originates in bone mar-row and usually spreads to more than one bone.Nurse practitioner—A registered nurse who isqualified to perform some specialized duties.The bone marrow of a healthy infant is primarily red dueto active production of red cells necessary for growth.
Abnormal results
Culture of bone marrow aspirate may yield informa-tion about an infectious agent. Microscopic examinationof bone marrow can reveal granulomas,myelofibrosis, lymphomas, leukemias, or other cancers. Analyzing spec-imens can help doctors diagnose iron deficiency, vitaminB
12deficiency, and folate deficiency, as well as anemia.Obesitycan affect the ease with which a bone mar-row biopsy can be done, and the results of either proce-dure can be affected if the patient has had radiationtherapyat the biopsy site.Resources

Bone marrow transplantation
Definition
The bone marrow—the sponge-like tissue found inthe center of certain bones—contains stem cells that arethe precursors of white blood cells, red blood cells, andplatelets. These blood cells are vital for normal bodyfunctions, such as oxygen transport, defense againstinfection and disease, and clotting. Blood cells have alimited lifespan and are constantly being replaced; there-fore, healthy stem cells are vital.In association with certain diseases, stem cells mayproduce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal bloodcells. Also, medical treatments may destroy stem cells oralter blood cell production. The resultant blood cellabnormalities can be life threatening.Bone marrow transplantation involves extractingbone marrow containing normal stem cells from ahealthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient whosebody cannot manufacture proper quantities of normalblood cells. The goal of the transplant is to rebuild therecipient’s blood cells and immune system and hopefullycure the underlying ailment.
Purpose
A person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, andplatelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due todisease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularlychemotherapyor radiation treatment, may destroy aperson’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s healthis severe. Under normal circumstances, red blood cellscarry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbondioxide from the body’s tissues. White blood cells formthe cornerstone of the body’s immune system and defendit against infection. Platelets limit bleeding by enablingthe blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged.A bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild thebody’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bringtheir numbers to normal levels. Illnesses that may betreated with a bone marrow transplant include both can-cerous and noncancerous diseases.Cancerous diseases may or may not specificallyinvolve blood cells; but,cancertreatment can destroy thebody’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone mar-row transplantation may be used in conjunction withadditional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for varioustypes of leukemia,Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, breastand ovarian cancer, and other cancers. Noncancerousdiseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be atreatment option include aplastic anemia,sickle celldisease,thalassemia, and severe immunodeficiency.
Precautions
Bone marrow transplants are not for everyone.Transplants are accompanied by a risk of infection, trans-plant rejection by the recipient’s immune system, andother complications. The procedure has a lower successrate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications areexacerbated for people whose health is already seriouslyimpaired as in late-stage cancers. Therefore, a person’sage or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrowtransplant. The typical cut-off age for a transplant rangesfrom 40 to 55 years; however, a person’s general health isusually the more important factor.Even in the absence of complications, the transplantand associated treatments are hard on the recipient. Bonemarrow transplants are debilitating. A person’s ability towithstand the rigors of the transplant is a key considera-tion in deciding to use this treatment.
Description
Autologous and allogeneic transplantsTwo important requirements for a bone marrowtransplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,the donor and the recipient may be the same person. Thistype of transplant is called an autologous transplant. It istypically used in cases in which a person’s bone marrowis generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medicaltreatment for diseases such as breast cancerand Hodgkin’s disease. Most bone marrow transplants areautologous. If a person’s bone marrow is unsuitable foran autologous transplant, the bone marrow must bederived from another person in an allogeneic transplant.Allogeneic transplants are more complicatedbecause of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 550Bone marrow transplantationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 550(HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. Ifthe donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens,the recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bonemarrow cells as invaders and launches a destructiveattack against them. Such an attack negates any benefitsoffered by the transplant.HLA matchingThere are only five major HLA classes or types—designated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but muchvariation within the groupings. For example, HLA–Afrom one individual may be similar to, but not the sameas, HLA–A in another individual; such a situation canrender a transplant from one to the other impossible.HLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip-ient are related, particularly if they are siblings; however,an unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only inrare cases is matching HLA types between two peoplenot an issue: if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi-cal twins carry the same genes; therefore, the same anti-gens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twinsis called a syngeneic transplant.Peripheral blood stem cell transplantsA relatively recent development in stem cell trans-plantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead ofstem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells(PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather thanfrom bone marrow, but the amount of stem cells found inthe peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount ofstem cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral bloodstem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneictransplants. The majority of PBSC transplants are autolo-gous. However, recent clinical studies indicate thatPBSCs are being used more frequently than bone mar-row for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.The advantages of PBSC transplants when comparedto bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic transplanta-tion, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster withPBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recur-rence, primarily graft-versus-host-disease. In autologoustransplantation, the use of PBSCs can result in fasterblood countrecoveries. Also, some medical conditionsexist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrowstem cell transplants, but can accept PBSC transplants.Some possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versusbone marrow transplantation are: so much more fluid vol-ume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at thetime of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, thefluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidneyproblems. Also, the time commitment for the donor for aPBSC transplant is considerable. When the PBSCs arebeing collected, several outpatient sessions are neededand each session lasts approximately two–four hours.The transplant procedure
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone mar-row extraction, or harvest, is the same whether for an autol-ogous or allogeneic transplant. Harvesting is done undergeneral anesthesia (i.e., the donor sleeps through the proce-dure), and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards. Bonemarrow is drawn from the iliac crest (the part of the hipbone to either side of the lower back) with a special needleand a syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary tocollect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately1–2 quarts (0.9-1.91). (This amount is only a small percent-age of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced with-in four weeks.) The donor remains at the hospital for 24–48hours and can resume normal activities within a few days.If the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans-plant, it is stored at –112 to –320°F (–80 to –196°C) untilit is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant issometimes treated to remove the donor’s T cells (a typeof white blood cell) or to remove ABO (blood type) anti-gens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 551Bone marrow transplantation
In autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells arecollected from the patient. Once the patient has undergonechemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the blood via an intra-venous catheter.The cells return to the bone marrow andbegin producing healthy new cells.(Illustration by Argosy Inc.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 551The bone marrow is administered to the recipient viaa catheter (a narrow, flexible tube) inserted into a largevein in the chest. From the bloodstream, it migrates tothe cavities within the bones where bone marrow is nor-mally stored. If the transplant is successful, the bonemarrow begins to produce normal blood cells once it is inplace, or engrafted.
PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION.

The blood travels from one arm into a bloodcell separator that removes only the stem cells, and therest of the blood is returned back to the donor, in theother arm. The cells are then frozen for later use.The PBSCs are administered to the recipient usingthe same methods as those used in bone marrow trans-plantation. As stated, the amount of fluid with PBSCsinfused into the recipient’s body can be an issue.

Conditioning rids the body of dis-eased cells and makes room for the marrow to be transplant-ed. It typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation treat-ment, depending on the disease being treated. Unfortunately,this treatment also destroys healthy cells and has many sideeffects such as extreme weakness, nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea. These side effects may continue for several weeks.
Aftercare
A two– to four–week waiting period follows the mar-row transplant before its success can begin to be judged.The marrow recipient is kept in isolationduring this timeto minimize potential infections. The recipient also
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 553Bone marrow transplantationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 553receives antibiotic medications and blood and platelettransfusions to help fight off infection and prevent exces-sive bleeding. Further side effects, such as nausea andvomiting, can be treated with other medications. Onceblood counts are normal and the side effects of the trans-plant abate, the recipient is taken off antibioticsand usu- ally no longer needs blood and platelet transfusions.Following discharge from the hospital, the recipient ismonitored through home visits by nurses or out-patient vis-its for up to a year. For the first several months out of thehospital, the recipient needs to be careful in avoidingpotential infections. For example, contact with other peoplewho may be ill should be avoided or kept to a minimum.Further blood transfusions and medications may be neces-sary, but barring complications, the recipient can return tonormal activities about 6–8 months after the transplant.
Risks
Bone marrow transplants are accompanied by seri-ous and life-threatening risks. Furthermore, they are notalways an absolute assurance of a cure for the underlyingailment; a disease may recur in the future. Approximate-ly 30% of people receiving allogeneic transplants do notsurvive. Autologous transplants have a much better sur-vival rate—nearly 90%—but are not appropriate for alltypes of ailments requiring a bone marrow transplant.Furthermore, they have a higher failure rate with certaindiseases, specifically leukemia.In the short term, there is the danger of pneumoniaor other infectious disease, excessive bleeding, or liverdisorder caused by blocked blood vessels. The transplantmay be rejected by the recipient’s immune system, or thedonor bone marrow may launch an immune-mediatedattack against the recipient’s tissues. This complication iscalled acute graft versus host disease, and it can be a life-threatening condition. Characteristic signs of the diseaseinclude fever, rash, diarrhea, liver problems, and a com-promised immune system.Approximately 25–50% of bone marrow transplantrecipients develop long-term complications. Chronic graftversus host disease symptoms include skin changes such asdryness, altered pigmentation, and thickening; abnormalliver function tests; dry mouthand eyes; infections; andweight loss. Other long-term complications includecataracts(due to radiation treatment), abnormal lung func-tion, hormonal abnormalities resulting in reduced growthor hypothyroidism, secondary cancers, and infertility.
Normal results
In a successful bone marrow transplant, the donor’smarrow migrates to the cavities in the recipient’s bonesand produces normal numbers of healthy blood cells.Bone marrow transplants can extend a person’s life,improve quality of life, and may aid in curing the under-lying ailment.ResourcesBOOKS

Bone nuclear medicine scan
Definition
A bone scan is a diagnostic procedure used to evalu-ate abnormalities involving bones and joints. A radioac-tive substance is injected intravenously, and the image ofits distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detectcertain diseases or conditions.
Purpose
Bone scans are most frequently ordered to checkwhether a cancerthat originated elsewhere has spread tothe bones. Cancers which begin in the breasts, kidneys,lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder are most like-ly to spread, or metastasize, to the bones. If metastasesare found, periodic bone scans may be ordered to see iftherapy is effective against a cancer.Some cancers arise in bone. These are called primarybone cancers. When an abnormality is found on an x ray ofa bone, a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a pri-mary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition.Infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) can be detectedor confirmed by a bone scan, often days or weeks beforean x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are useful in diag-nosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both theprogression of the disease and the effectiveness of treat-ment. Unexplained painmay be evaluated with a bonescan, because it can demonstrate fractureswhich are dif-ficult to detect on x ray. Bone scans can be used to see ifartificial joints have loosened or become infected. Sus-pected child abusemay be evaluated with a bone scan,due to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeatedtrauma. Abnormalities caused by altered circulation tothe bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan.
Precautions
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldnot have this test. A patient who is unable to remain stillfor an extended period of time may require sedationfor a bone scan.
Description
This test is performed in a radiology facility, eitherin a hospital department or an outpatient x-ray center.The patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactivesubstance is injected through a vein in the arm. For abone scan, the radionuclide used is specifically chosen toaccumulate in the bone. The patient then waits from threeto four hours, for the substance to collect within theskeletal system. During this time, he or she will beinstructed to drink several glasses of water. Patients arefree to get up and move around as they desire during thiswaiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just beforethe scanning begins, the patient should empty his or herbladder again. This ensures that a lot of radioactive mate-rial is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, whichcould obscure part of the pelvic bones.During the scan, the patient lies on his or her backon a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or sideduring the study. It is important for the patient not tomove, except when directed to by the technologist.The radionuclide scanner, sometimes called agamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positionedagainst the body part to be examined. Either the camera,the table, or both, may change position during the study.For a total body bone scan, the patient is scanned fromhead to foot, over a period of 30-60 minutes. Patientsshould experience no discomfort from this examination.A special kind of bone scan, called a SPECT (SinglePhoton Emission Computed Tomography) scan may beadded, to study a particular part of the body in moredetail. Suspected diseases of the hips, lower back, or jaw
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 555Bone nuclear medicine scanGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 555are often evaluated using this study. It usually takes anadditional 30-45 minutes. The camera circles completelyaround the area in question or multiple cameras are usedto create a cross-sectional image. This helps pinpoint thelocation of the abnormality being evaluated.Another variation is called a three-phase, or three-stage, bone scan. The procedure is the same, except thescanning takes place immediately after the radioactivesubstance is injected, approximately 20 minutes after theinjection, then two to four hours later.
Preparation
Some specialized blood studies should be drawnbefore this study is begun. Jewelry or metallic objectsneed to be removed. No other special physical prepara-tion is required.The patient should understand that there is no dan-ger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others, asonly small amounts of the radioisotope are used. Thetotal dose of radiation absorbed is minimal, often lessthan the amount received from ordinary x rays. Theradionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all,but detects and records it from the patient.
Aftercare
Fluids are encouraged after the scan to aid in theexcretion of the radioisotope. It is almost completelyeliminated from the body within 24 hours.
Normal results
The normal appearance of the scan will vary accord-ing to the patient’s age. In general, a uniform concentra-tion of radionuclide uptake is present in all bones in anormal scan.
Abnormal results
A high concentration of radionuclide occurs in areasof increased bone activity. These regions appear brighterand may be referred to as “hot spots”. They may indicateKEY TERMS

How-ever, it is not a very specific examination, and often can-not distinguish exactly what disease process is causingan abnormality.

Bone x rays
Definition
Bone x rays are a diagnostic test in which ionizingradiation passing through the bones being examinedenables an image to be produced on film.
Purpose
Bone x rays are ordered to detect disease or injury tothe bone such as broken bones, tumors, and other prob-lems. They can determine bone density, texture, erosion,and changes in bone relationships. Bone x rays also eval-uate the joints for diseases such as osteoarthritis.
Precautions
Precautions should be taken to protect patients fromunnecessary exposure to radiation. Patients should beshielded with lead aprons as much as possible. Women ofchildbearing age who could be pregnant should not havex rays of their trunk or pelvic regions. The fetus is espe-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 556Bone x raysGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 556cially at risk during the first trimester of pregnancy. Women who are pregnant should not have x rays of theirpelvic region, lumbar spine, and abdomen unlessabsolutely necessary. If other types of x rays are neces-sary, a lead apron should be used to shield the abdominaland pelvic regions.
Description
X rays are a common diagnostic test in which a formof energy called x-ray radiation penetrates the patient’sbody. In bone x rays, electrical current passes through anx-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing radiation thatpasses through the bone(s) being examined. This producesa picture of the inside of the body on film. The physicianreads the developed x ray on a wall-mounted light box.Digital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con-ventional equipment is used to take the x ray but theimage is produced via computer. In a digital x ray, theimage is created on a reusable plate. After being read bya laser reader, the information is sent in digital form to astorage unit connected to a computer network fromwhich the radiologist reads the x ray. An electronic reportcan then be sent to the patient’s physician.Problems with bones that x rays can detect resultfrom injury or from disease caused by a malfunction inthe patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especiallybroken bones (fractures), are common and can beaccurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are espe-cially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete frac-tures which can’t be detected during a physical exami-nation. X rays can also be used to check for bone posi-tion in a fracture. Some bone diseases can be definitive-ly diagnosed with bone x rays while others requireadditional tests.Osteoporosis, a common bone disease, can be detect-ed in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered to deter-mine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rick-ets, a blood test and x rays of the affected bone are usuallydefinitive; in some cases a bone biopsy(microscopicanalysis of a small ammount of tissue) is also done. In arare bone disease called Paget’s disease, x rays may beused in conjunction with bone, blood, and urine tests tomake a diagnosis. In another rare bone disease, fibrousdysplasia, bone x rays or a bone biopsy (microscopicanalysis of a small amount of tissue) are used to confirmthe diagnosis. Bone x rays are definitive in diagnosingosteogenesis imperfecta. For osteomyelitis, bone x raysare used in conjunction with a blood test, bone scan, orneedle biopsy to make the diagnosis. For arthritis, x raysof the bone are occasionally used in conjunction withblood tests. In bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful butthey may not be definitive.Bone x rays are performed by a technician or radiol-ogist, and interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken ina physician’s office, radiology unit, outpatient clinic, ordiagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than 10minutes. There is no painor discomfort associated withthe test, but some people find it difficult to remain still.The results are often available in minutes.During the test, the patient lies on a table. The tech-nician taking the x ray will check the patient’s position-ing and place the x-ray machine over the part of the bodybeing examined. After asking the patient to remainmotionless, he or she steps out of the area and presses abutton to take the picture.
Preparation
The patient is asked to remove clothing, jewelry, andany other metal objects from the area being x rayed. Ifappropriate, a lead shield will be placed over other bodyparts to minimize exposure to radiation.
Aftercare
The patient can immediately resume normal activities.
Risks
The human body contains some natural radiationand is also exposed to radiation in the environment.There is a slight risk from exposure to radiation duringbone x rays, however, the amount of radiation is smalland the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organsare exposed to radiation, genetic alterations may occur.Excessive or repeated doses of radiation can causechanges in other types of body tissue. No radiationremains in the body after the x ray.
Normal results
Normal bones show no fractures, dislocations, orother abnormalities.
Abnormal results
Results that indicate the presence of bone injury ordisease differ in appearance according to the nature of theinjury/disease. For example, fractures show up as clearbreaks in the bones, while osteoporotic bone has the sameshape as a normal bone on an x ray but is less dense.Resources

Definition
Botulinum is a bacterium (Clostridium botulinum) that produces seven different toxins that can cause botulism and is also medically used to block muscle contractions.
Purpose
Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection is used in condi-tions of excessive and inappropriate muscle contraction,hyperhidiosis (excess sweating) in armpits and palms,spasticity (persistent states of muscle contraction), sphinc-ter contraction, eye-movement disorders, tics and tremors, and cosmetically to treat facial lines and wrinkles.Botox has also been explored in the treatment ofchronic muscle tension and migraine headaches. Therelief is likely due to the decrease in localized musclespasms, as no direct effect of Botox on the sensorynerves has been established.
Precautions
Botulinum toxin is produced from the bacterium thatcauses food poisoningin humans. High doses of thetoxin can be fatal; however, doses administered therapeu-tically are so small that harmful effects are uncommon.
Description
The number of potential applications for botulinumtoxin extends to every muscle group. The first therapeu-tic use of Botox was in the treatment of strabismus(eyes are unable to direct towards the same object) and sincethen it has been used to treat a variety of involuntarymuscle contractions or disorders. Its cosmetic use is theresult of treatment for facial spasms where smoothing offacial lines was reported by patients. In general, 90% ofinjections for facial spasms are resolved satisfactorily.Toxin type A has a duration of effect that lastsapproximately three months and is the therapeutic agentof choice for most conditions.
Preparation
The dosage of Botox must be monitored and adjust-ed, with multiple injections showing a lower incidence ofcomplications versus administration by one larger dose.
Risks
In over 30 years of therapeutic use in humans, botu-linum toxin has proven to be remarkably safe. Difficul-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 558Botulinum toxin injectionsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 558ties associated with administration of toxin are: differentpatients may experience different effects at the samedose, patients new to the treatment may experience exag-gerated effects at subsequent visits and/or neighboringmuscles may become activated at subsequent treatments.Additional side effects may include excessive mus-cle weakness at the injection site or adjacent muscles.These effects typically resolve quickly. Occasionally,patients report flu-like symptoms but they are usuallyself-limited.A certain percentage of patients may also experienceresistance to the toxin. The presence of circulating anti-bodies to the toxin is presumed to be the primary reasonfor resistance to Botox injections. Patients who have lit-tle reaction to Botox ‘A’ may benefit from injectionsusing one of the other six serotypes. Using the smallesteffective dose limits the likelihood of immunoresistancein unresponsive patients.
Normal results
The anticipated outcome of Botox injections isrelaxation of the target muscle tissue. The pharmacologi-cal effects of botulinum toxin are typically isolated tolocal areas and do not result in tissue destruction or pro-longed paralysis. Varying the dose can deliver a preciseamount of toxin to achieve graded degrees of paralysisfor the desired level of response.Resources

Botulism
Definition
Botulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a naturalpoison produced by certain bacteria in the Clostridiumgenus. Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostlyfrom eating contaminated food, or in infants, from cer-tain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum toxinblocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, theneurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles, andflaccid paralysisoccurs. As botulism progresses, themuscles that control the airway and breathing fail.
Description
Botulism occurs rarely, but it incites concernbecause of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions ofbotulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancientRome and Greece. However, the relationship betweencontaminated food and botulism wasn’t defined until thelate 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, JustiniusKerner, deduced that a substance in spoiled sausages,which he called wurstgift(German for sausage poison),caused botulism. The toxin’s origin and identityremained elusive until Emile von Ermengem, a Belgianprofessor, isolated Clostridium botulinumin 1895 andidentified it as the poison source.Three types of botulism have been identified: food-borne, wound, and infant botulism. The main differencebetween types hinges on the route of exposure to thetoxin. In the United States, there are approximately 110cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne botu-lism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and can betraced to eating contaminated home-preserved food.Infant botulism accounts for 72% of all cases, but therecovery rate is good (about 98%) with proper treatment.Though domestic food poisoningis a problemworld-wide, there has been a growing concern regardingthe use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 559BotulismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 559ist acts. The Iraqi government admitted in 1995 that ithad loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into SCUDmissiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these special mis-siles were never used. As of 1999, there were 17 coun-tries known to be developing biological weapons, includ-ing the culture of botulism toxins.
Causes and symptoms
CausesToxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu-linumis the main culprit in botulism. Other members ofthe clostridiumgenus can produce botulinum toxin,namely C. argentinense,C. butyricum, and C. baratii,b u t they are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria require alow-acid, oxygen-free environment that is warm (40-120°F or 4.4-48.8°C) and moist. Lacking these condi-tions, the bacteria transform themselves into spores that,like plant seeds, can remain dormant for years. Clostridiaand their spores exist all over the world, especially in soiland aquatic sediments. They do not threaten human oranimal health until the spores encounter an environmentthat favors growth. The spores then germinate, and thegrowing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin.Scientists have discovered that clostridia can produceat least seven types of botulism toxin, identified as A, B,C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually affected by A, B, E,and very rarely F. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cat-tle, and mink are affected by botulism C toxin, which alsoaffects birds and has caused massive die-offs in domesticbird flocks and wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin cancause illness in cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A,B, and C toxin. There have been no confirmed human oranimal botulism cases linked to the G toxin.In humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specificproteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroysthem. These proteins control the release of acetyl-choline, a neurotransmitter that stimulates musclecells. With acetylcholine release blocked, nerves arenot able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinumtoxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of med-icine due to this action. Certain medical disorders arecharacterized by involuntary and uncontrollable mus-cle contractions. Medical researchers have discoveredthat injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinumtoxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive musclecontractions. The muscle is partially paralyzed andnormal movement is retained.
Symptoms
The three types of human botulism include the fol-lowing symptoms:• Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved orstored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing clostridia.Botulism symptoms typically appear within 18-36 hoursof eating contaminated food, with extremes of fourhours to eight days. Initial symptoms include blurred ordouble vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking.Possible gastrointestinal problems include constipation, nausea, and vomiting. As botulism progresses, the vic-tim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with thehead muscles and progressing down the body. Breathingbecomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care,respiratory failureand deathare very likely.• Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.Unlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are vul-nerable to C. botulinumcolonizing the intestine. Infantsingest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore-containing dust. The spores germinate in the largeintestine and, as the bacteria grow, they produce botu-linum toxin that is absorbed into the infant’s body. Thefirst symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poorfeeding. As infant botulism progresses, sucking andswallowing (thus eating) become difficult. A nursingmother will often notice breast engorgement as the firstsign of her infant’s illness. The baby suffers overallweakness and cannot control head movements. Becauseof the flaccid paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears“floppy.” Breathing is impaired, and death from respira-tory failure is a very real danger.• Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have beenlinked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to theextremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound botu-lism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected woundand produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms usuallyappear four to 18 days after an injury occurs and aresimilar to food-borne botulism, although gastrointesti-nal symptoms may be absent.Diagnosis
Diagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp-toms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulismmay be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome, myas- thenia gravis, drug reactions,stroke, or nervous systeminfection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide oratropine), or shellfish poisoning. Sepsisis the most com-mon initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure tothrivemay also be suspected. Some reports have linkedinfant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syn-drome(SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests areused for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems like-ly, treatment starts immediately.While waiting for laboratory results, doctors askabout recently consumed food and work to dismiss other
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 560BotulismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 560disease possibilities. A physical examinationis done with an emphasis on the nervous system. As part of thisexamination, CT scans, MRIs, electromyographic tests,or lumbar punctures may be ordered. Laboratory testsinvolve testing a suspected food and/or the patient’sserum, feces, or other specimens for traces of botulinumtoxin or clostridia.
Treatment
DrugsAdults with botulism are treated with an antitoxinderived from horse serum that is distributed by the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention. The antitoxin(effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inactivatesonly the botulinum toxin that is unattached to nerve end-ings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually within 24 hoursof onset of symptoms) can preserve nerve endings, pre-vent progression of the disease, and reduce mortality.Infants, however, cannot receive the antitoxin usedfor adults. For them, human botulism immune globulin(BIG) is available in the United States through the InfantBotulism Treatment and Prevention Program in Berkeley,California. BIG neutralizes toxin types A, B, C, D, and EKEY TERMS
Acetylcholine—A chemical released by nerve cellsto signal other cells.Antitoxin—A substance that inactivates a poison(e.g., toxin) and protects the body from beinginjured by it.CT scan—The abbreviated term for computed orcomputerized axial tomography. The test involvesinjecting a radioactive substance into the body.Computers are used to scan for radiation and createthree-dimensional images of internal organs.Electromyographic test—A medical test whichdetermines if a muscle’s response to electrical stim-uli. The test results allow medical personnel toassess how nerves to the muscle are functioning.Flaccid paralysis—Paralysis characterized by limp,unresponsive muscles.Lumbar puncture—A procedure in which a smallamount of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from thelower spine. Examination of this fluid helps diag-nose certain illnesses.MRI—The abbreviated term for magnetic resonanceimaging. MRI uses a large circular magnet and radiowaves to generate signals from atoms in the body.These signals are used to construct images of inter-nal structures.Neurotransmitter—A chemical found in nerveswhich relays nerve signals to other cells. Acetyl-choline is a neurotransmitter.Sepsis—The presence of infection-causing organ-isms or associated toxins in the blood or withinbody tissues.Spores—A state of “suspended animation” thatsome bacteria can adopt when conditions are notideal for growth. Spores are analogous to plantseeds and can germinate into growing bacteriawhen conditions are right.Toxin—A poisonous substance produced by amicroorganism, plant, or animal.Tracheostomy—The procedure used to open a holein the neck to the trachea, or windpipe. It is some-times used in conjunction with a respirator.before they can bind to nerves. This antitoxin can pro-vide protection against A and B toxins for approximatelyfour months. Though many infants recover with support-ive care, BIG cuts hospital stay in half, and thereforereduces hospital costs by 50% as well.Aside from antitoxin, no drugs are used to treat botu-lism. Antibioticsare not effective for preventing or treatingbotulism. In fact, antibiotic use is discouraged for infantsbecause dying bacteria could potentially release more toxininto a baby’s system. Antibiotics can be used, however, totreat secondary respiratory tract and other infections.Respiratory supportTreatment for infants usually involves intensive respi-ratory support and tube feeding for weeks or even months.Once an infant can breathe unaided, physical therapy isinitiated to help the child relearn how to suck and swallow.A respirator is often required to help adult patientsbreathe, and a tracheostomy may also be necessary.SurgerySurgery may be necessary to clean an infected woundand remove the source of the bacteria that is producing thetoxin. Antimicrobial therapy may be necessary.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 561BotulismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 561Gastric lavageWhen botulism is caused by food, it often is neces-sary to flush the gastrointestinal tract (gastric lavage).Often cathartic agents or enemasare used. It is importantto avoid products that contain magnesium, since magne-sium enhances the effect of the toxin.
Prognosis
With medical intervention, botulism victims canrecover completely, albeit slowly. It takes weeks tomonths to recover from botulism, and severe cases cantake years before a total recovery is attained. Recoverydepends on the nerve endings building new proteins toreplace those destroyed by botulinum toxin.
Prevention
Vaccines against botulism do not exist to preventinfant botulism or other forms of the disease. Foodsafety is the surest prevention for botulism. Botulinumtoxin cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted, so the wisestcourse is to discard any food that seems spoiled without tasting it. Home canners must be diligent about usingsterile equipment and following U.S. Department ofAgriculture canning guidelines. If any part of a cannedfood container is rusty or bulging, the food should notbe eaten. Infant botulism is difficult to prevent, becausecontrolling what goes into an infant’s mouth is oftenbeyond control, especially in regard to spores in the air.One concrete preventative is to never feed honey toinfants younger than 12 months since it is one knownsource of botulism spores. As infants begin eating solidfoods, the same food precautions should be followed asfor adults.Resources

Bowel preparation
Definition
Bowel preparation is a procedure usually undertakenbefore a diagnosis and /or treatment can be initiated for cer-tain colon and rectum diseases. Bowel preparation is acleansing of the intestines from fecal matter and secretions.
Purpose
The ultimate goal of bowel preparation is priming thebowel for a diagnosis procedure (using x rays to detect adisease process in the intestines) or for surgical interven-tion (such as removal of polyps,cancer, or narrowing ofthe intestinal diameter). Colonoscopyis an effectivetreatment procedure for polyps (a growing mass of tis-sue). This procedure enables visualization of the entirelarge bowel. During a colonoscopy, polyps can be cauter-ized (applying an electric current which incinerates thepolyp). The procedure can be both diagnostic and thera-peutic. A sigmoidoscopyscope is a flexible tube thatallows clinicians to view the sigmoid colon (the part ofthe large intestine before the rectum). This procedure isimportant for detection of colon/rectal cancer. It is safe,quick to perform (usually 30–45 minutes in about 90% ofcases), and an effective diagnostic tool for evaluation of:• rectal bleeding• other studies that showed an abnormality• removal of polyps• biopsy• evaluation of chronic diarrheaor inflammatory boweldisease• to detect recurrences for colon/rectal cancer or polyps• relieving a twisted bowel• foreign body removal• treating bleeding lesions• preventive surveillance of cancer in patients with a pos-itive family history of colon cancer
Precautions
Antibiotic prophylaxisis not routinely recommend-ed. In some cases of prosthetic heart valves,antibioticscan be prescribed. Evidence exists that evacuation ofintestinal waste products in conjunction with antibiotics
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 562Bowel preparationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 562before (prophylactic) the procedure reduces the possibili-ty of sepsis(infection which spreads from the primarysite to blood).
Description
The bowel is emptied of any contents for proceduressuch as barium enema(introducing a barium containingchemical to promote better visualization of intestinesduring x rays) or colonoscopy. Preparation of the boweldistally—from the rectum—is necessary for diagnosticprocedures such as sigmoidoscopy. Prior to surgical pro-cedures bowel preparation is recommended to decreasethe possibility of developing more medical problems.Patients may also be given a course of antibiotics to pre-vent the possibility of infection.
Preparation
Bowel preparation for visualization of the colon is per-formed to ensure the procedure will be accurate and com-plete. There are several effective cleansing preparationsthat include: Polyethylene glycol solution, Magnesium cit-rate with bisacodyl tablets, and Castor oil with bisacodyltablets. One of these preparations should be administeredstarting at 4:00 
P.M. the day before the procedure.
Aftercare
After the preparation has been ingested the patient isadvised to only ingest clear liquids until midnight.
Risks
The current standard of care dictates that patientsreceive antibiotic prophylaxis if they are high risk fordeveloping an infection. High-risk patients include thosewith cardiac diseases or patients who have a prostheses.
Normal results
Absence of anatomical changes or abnormalities inthe intestines would result in normal diagnosis.
Abnormal results
Polyps can be treated with electrocautery. A biopsyis taken of any suspicious polyps and further analyzed.Sigmoidoscopy can detect masses, bleeding, and ulcera-tive disease.Resources

Bowel resection
Definition
A bowel resection is a surgical procedure in which apart of the large or small intestine is removed.
Purpose
Bowel resection may be performed to treat variousdisorders of the intestine, including cancer, obstruction,inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum,ischemia(compromised blood supply), or traumatic injury.
Description
The preferred type of bowel resection involvesremoval of the diseased portion of intestine, and surgical-ly re-joining the remaining ends. In this procedure, thecontinuity of the bowel is maintained and normal passageof stool is preserved. When deemed necessary by the sur-geon, the diseased portion of the bowel may be removed,and the functioning end of the intestine may be broughtout onto the surface of the abdomen, forming an tempo-rary or permanent ostomy. Use of the large intestine toform the ostomy results in a colostomy; use of smallintestine to form the ostomy results in an ileostomy.
Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will berequired to sign a consent form after the procedure is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 563Bowel resectionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 563explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, alongwith various x rays and an electrocardiogram (EKG) maybe ordered as the doctor deems necessary. In order toempty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placedon a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. Aliquid diet may be ordered for at least the day beforesurgery, with nothing taken by mouth after midnight. Aseries of enemasand/or oral preparations (GoLytely orColyte), may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool.Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, orkanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacteriain the intestine and help prevent post-operative infection.A nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose into thestomach on the day of surgery or during surgery. Thisremoves the gastric secretions and prevents nausea andvomiting. A urinary catheter (thin tube inserted into thebladder) may also be inserted to keep the bladder emptyduring surgery, giving more space in the surgical fieldand decreasing chances of accidental injury.
Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient who has had abowel resection, as with those who have had any majorsurgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse,respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be shal-low because of the effect of anesthesia and the patient’sreluctance to breathe deeply and experience painthat is caused by the abdominal incision. The patient is instruct-ed how to support the operative site during deep breath-ing and coughing, and is given pain medication as neces-sary. Fluid intake and output is measured, and the opera-tive site is observed for color and amount of wounddrainage. The nasogastric tube will remain in place,KEY TERMS
Diverticulum—Small tubes or pouches that pro-ject off the wall of the intestine, visible as opaqueon an x ray after the patient has swallowed a con-trast (dye) substance.Embolism—Blockage of a blood vessel by anysmall piece of material traveling in the blood. Theemboli may be caused by germs, air, blood clots,or fat.Ischemia—A compromise in blood supply to bodytissues that causes tissue damage or death.Ostomy—A surgically-created opening in theabdomen for elimination of waste products (urineor stool).attached to low intermittent suction until bowel activityresumes. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenous-ly until the patient’s diet can gradually be resumed,beginning with liquids and advancing to a regular diet astolerated. The patient is generally out of bed approxi-mately eight to 24 hours after surgery. Postoperativeweight loss follows almost all bowel resections. Weightand strength are slowly regained over a period of months.
Risks
Potential complications of this abdominal surgeryinclude:• excessive bleeding• surgical wound infection• incisional hernia(An organ projects through the mus-cle wall that surrounds it. The hernia occurs through thesurgical scar.)• thrombophlebitis (inflammation and blood clot to veinsin the legs)• pneumonia• pulmonary embolism(blood clot or air bubble in thelungs’ blood supply)
Normal results
Complete healing is expected without complicationsafter bowel resection. The period of time required forrecovery from the surgery may vary depending of thepatient’s overall health status prior to surgery.
Abnormal results
The doctor should be made aware of any of the fol-lowing problems after surgery:• increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleedingin the surgical area• headache, muscle aches,dizziness,f e v e r• increased abdominal pain or swelling,constipation, nau- sea or vomiting, rectal bleeding, or black, tarry stoolsResources

Bowel training
Definition
Bowel training helps to reestablish normal bowelmovements in persons who suffer from constipation, diarrhea, incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowelactivity is considered one or two movements of moderatesize every day.
Purpose
Many people for many reasons have irregular bowelfunction. In some cases, the irregularity lasts beyond thecondition that caused it. The bowels by themselves developbad habits that can be retrained with suitable exercises andeducation. Normal bowel habits not only improve the qual-ity of life, they help prevent several common diseases—forexample, diverticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones,appendicitis,colon cancer, hiatal hernia, diabetes, andheart disease have also been related to the quality of bowelmovements and the foods that affect them.• One of the most common causes of constipation is thelaxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of thebowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so thatthey will no longer move without artificial stimulants.The laxative habit begins innocently enough with thecorrect belief that bowels should move every day, how-ever,laxativeswill cause the evacuation of several daysworth of stool in a single movement. Impatient for stoolto reaccumulate for the necessary few days, the patienttakes another laxative, and the cycle begins.• The other major cause of constipation is a diet withinsufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works moresmoothly the more contents it has. Western dietsof highly refined foods have eliminated most of the residuefrom food. The result is that most food is absorbed, leav-ing little to pass through and be excreted as feces.• Constipation occurs acutely with impaction—the pres-ence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to pass.Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowelhabits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, andinadequate physical activity.• Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt thebowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.• Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowelreflexes.
Description
Bowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normalreflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.Naturally the patient must be able and willing to cooper-ate. Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxa-tives that they are afraid to do without them. It takes timefor a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel toregain its normal rhythm. Trust and patience are necessary.After gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next stepis to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements requireingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foods.The patient should drink two to three quarts of liquidsevery day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice and per-haps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk comesfrom unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran, brown rice,green vegetables, apples, and pears are a few examples ofhigh residue foods. Many patients will benefit fromadding bulk preparations of psyllium. Constipating foodslike bananas and cheese should be avoided until a naturalrhythm is well established.To assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily, itis a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day asneeded. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.There is usually a time of day when bowel move-ments are more likely to occur. In anticipation of thistime, the patient should participate in activities that stim-ulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating unre-fined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee, encour-age natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use lubricantssuch as glycerine suppositories or oil enemasat this time. For severe constipation, water enemas may beneeded to initiate a movement.It is also important for the patient to recognize theurge to defecate and to respond right away to that urge.The longer stool sits in the rectum, the more water therectum will absorb from it, making it harder and moredifficult to pass.
Normal results
With patience and diligence, normal bowel habitsand the health that comes with them will return in mostpatients.

Brain abscess
Definition
Brain abscessis a bacterial infection within the brain.
Description
The brain is usually well insulated from infection bybacteria, protected by the skull, the meninges (tissue lay-ers surrounding the brain), the immune system, and thehighly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and thebrain. Under certain circumstances, however, bacteriacan invade the brain and cause a localized infectioncalled an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare,accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Singleabscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder ofcases involve multiple abscesses. If not treated, brainabscess is almost always fatal.KEY TERMS
Defecate—To pass feces (stool) out of the rectumthrough the anus.Diverticulitis—Infection of outpouchings in thelarge bowel.Fecal impaction—Obstruction of the rectum by alarge mass of feces (stool).Hiatal hernia—Part of the stomach displacedthrough the diaphragm into the chest.Causes and symptoms
One-half of all brain abscesses are caused by thespread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources ofbacteria include:• middle ear infections (otitis media) or infections in thebony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis) • sinus infections• an abscessed tooth.Other sources of bacteria include:• lung infections• abdominal infection• infection of the heart’s lining (endocarditis)• penetrating head wounds• neurosurgeryAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or the presence of another immune deficiency greatlyincreases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately 25%of cases have no detectable cause of infection.Brain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ-isms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.Many times brain abscess cases are caused by two ormore bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria combina-tion includes streptococci, microorganisms that can livewithout oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A smallnumber of cases are caused by yeast, fungi, and single-cell organisms (protozoa).The symptoms of brain abscess often develop slow-ly, usually within a period of about two weeks. The mostcommon symptoms are:• headache• neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of thebrain that is infected• altered mental status• seizuresFeverand stiff neck occur in less than one-third ofcases. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, eyetremor (nystagmus), poor balance, and uncoordinatedmovements.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using acomputed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic reso-nance imaging(MRI) scan to determine the site ofinfection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performedas well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type ofbacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule out
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 566Brain abscessGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 566tumor or other noninfectious localized lesions, whichmay look the same on the scans.Other tests are performed to determine the source ofthe infection. These tests include blood cultures, x raysof the chest, and a physical exam of the ears, sinuses, andteeth. A test for human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV)is usually also performed.
Treatment
Treatment for brain abscess begins with intravenousantibiotics, chosen to match the infecting bacterium ifknown, or to cover a wide spectrum of possibilities if not.Treatment usually continues for six to eight weeks.Aspiration surgery is almost always done to drain theabscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the infect-ed site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) fromthe abscess. Aspiration may be repeated several timesuntil the bacteria are completely killed or removed. Surgi-cal removal of infected or dead tissue may be needed insome cases. For patients with many sites of infection,aspiration or surgical removal is not done because of theincreased difficulty and risk of the procedure. For thesepatients, antibiotic therapy alone is used. Steroid treat-ment is controversial, but may be indicated in some cases.
Prognosis
Even with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal inabout 20% of cases. About half of those who survivehave some residual neurological problems, includingseizures in many patients.There are several reasons why patients with brainabscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may notbe diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis may takeadditional time. The patient may receive an antibioticthat does not match the infecting organism. Sometimesthe infection may not be limited to a definite area in thebrain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. Thesmall number of cases caused by fungal infection maytake additional time to diagnose. A patient may also havea poor prognosis because there is more than one abscess,the location of the abscess may be deep within the brain,or the infection may have moved into many locationswithin the brain. Severe complications can result frombrain abscess, including comma and brain rupture. In 80-100% of cases involving brain rupture, the patient dies.
Prevention
Brain abscess may be preventable by prompt andaggressive treatment of the infections which give rise toit, especially sinus and ear infections.KEY TERMS
Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for exami-nation.Aspiration—Removal of fluid from a closed spacethrough a needle.

Brain biopsy
Definition
A brain biopsy is the removal of a small piece ofbrain tissue for the diagnosis of abnormalities of thebrain, such as Alzheimer’s disease, tumors, infection, orinflammation.
Purpose
By examining the tissue sample under a microscope,the biopsy sample provides doctors with the informationnecessary to guide diagnosis and treatment.
Precautions
Imaging of the brain is performed to determine theprecise positioning of the needle to enter the brain.
Description
When an abnormality of the brain is suspected,Stereotactic (probing in three dimensions) brain needlebiopsy is performed and guided precisely by a computersystem to avoid serious complications. A small hole is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 567Brain biopsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 567drilled into the skull, and a needle is inserted into thebrain tissue guided by computer-assisted imaging tech-niques (CT or MRI scans). Historically, the patient’shead was held in a rigid frame to direct the probe into thebrain; however since the early nineties, it has been possi-ble to perform these biopsies without the frame. Sincethe frame was attached to the skull with screws, thisadvancement is less invasive and better tolerated by thepatient. The doctor (pathologist) prepares the sample foranalysis and studies it further under a microscope.
Preparation
A CT or MRI brain scan is done to find the positionwhere the biopsy will be performed. Prior to the biopsy,the patient is placed under general anesthesia.
Aftercare
The patient is monitored in the recovery room forseveral hours and is usually required to spend a few daysin the hospital since general anesthesia is required.
Risks
The procedure is invasive and includes risks associ-ated with anesthesia and surgery. Brain injury may occurKEY TERMS

The resulting scar, left onthe brain has the potential to trigger seizures. Normal results
After examining the brain tissue directly, no abnor-malities are detected.
Abnormal results
Various brain abnormalities can be diagnosed bymicroscopic analysis of the tissue sample. The pathologist(a physician trained in how disease affects the body’s tis-sues) looks for abnormal growth, changes in cell mem-branes, and/or abnormal collections of cells. In Alzheimer’sdisease, the cortex of the brain contains abnormal collec-tions of plaques. If infection is suspected, the infectiousorganism can be cultured from the tissue and identified.Classification of tumors is also possible after biopsy.Resources

Brain tumor
Definition
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in thebrain. Unlike other tumors, brain tumors spread by local
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 568Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 568extension and rarely metastasize (spread) outside thebrain. A benign brain tumor is composed of non-cancer-ous cells and does not metastasize beyond the part of thebrain where it originates. A brain tumor is consideredmalignant if it contains cancercells, or if it is composedof harmless cells located in an area where it suppressesone or more vital functions.
Description
Each year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are diag-nosed in the United States. About half of all primarybrain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening locations.The rest are malignant and invasive.Benign brain tumorsBenign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells,have clearly defined borders, can usually be completelyremoved, and are unlikely to recur. Benign brain tumorsdo not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause severe pain, permanent brain damage, and death. Benign braintumors sometimes become malignant.Malignant brain tumorsMalignant brain tumors do not have distinct borders.They tend to grow rapidly, increasing pressure within thebrain (IICP) and can spread in the brain or spinal cordbeyond the point where they originate. It is highly unusu-al for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the cen-tral nervous system (CNS).Primary brain tumorsPrimary brain tumors originate in the brain. Theyrepresent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all cancerdeaths.Metastatic or secondary brain tumorsApproximately 25% of all cancer patients developsecondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer cellsspread from another part of the body to the brain. Sec-ondary brain tumors are most apt to occur in patientswho have:• breast cancer.• colon cancer.• kidney cancer.• lung cancer.• melanoma (cancer) of the skin. These metastatic braintumors can develop on any part of the brain or spinalcord.• cancer within the nasal passages and/or throat that fol-low the nerve pathways into the skull, and metastasizeto the brain.Who gets brain tumorsBrain tumors can develop at any age, but are mostcommon in children between the ages of 3-12, and inadults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the secondmost common cause of cancer death between birth andthe age of 34, and the fourth most common cause of can-cer death in men aged 35-54. Primary tumors of the brainand central nervous system are often associated with HIVinfection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of devel-oping brain tumors. Other risk factors being studiedinclude children with a history of previous radiation treat-ment to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an olderfather; having well-educated parents; occupational expo-sure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history ofepilepsy; history of certain genetic conditions (tuberoussclerosis,neurofibromatosis, von Hippel Lindau,famil- ial polyposis, Osler-Weber-Rendu, Li-Fraumeni).Naming and grading brain tumorsThe name of a brain tumor describes where it origi-nates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it contains. Atumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to:• how malignant it is• how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invadeother tissues• how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The moreabnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely togrow)Low-grade brain tumors usually have well-definedborders. Some low-grade brain tumors form or areenclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade braintumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread through-out the brain, but rarely metastasize to other parts of thebody.Mid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more rapid-ly than low-grade tumors. Described as “truly malig-nant,” these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue. Thegrowth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entiretumor, and these tumors recur more often than low-gradetumors.A single brain tumor can contain several differenttypes of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by thehighest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under amicroscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are lessmalignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any gradethat grows into surrounding tissue.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 569Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 569Types of brain tumorsGlioma is the term used to refer to the most preva-lent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial tis-sue, which supports and nourishes cells that send mes-sages from the brain to other parts of the body. Thesetumors may be either malignant or benign. Astrocy-tomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are three ofthe most common gliomas.
ASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape oftheir cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of thebrain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas growslowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue. Mild-to-mod-erately anaplastic astrocytomas with well-differentiatedborders do not grow as slowly as non-infiltrating astrocy-tomas, and they do spread to surrounding tissues.Anaplastic astrocytomas, which are also calledGrade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and growmore rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-moderatelyanaplastic tumors.Grade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30% of allprimary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common braintumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are the most malig-nant of all brain tumors. Because they contain a greatermixture of cells than any other brain tumor, they are themost difficult to treat.
EPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,ependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and 5% ofall intracranial tumors. These tumors, which are mostcommon in children and adolescents, begin in the verythin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that contain it.Ependymomas are usually benign, have well-differ-entiated borders, resemble normal cells, and grow veryslowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant) ependymo-mas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cellsof benign tumors.
MIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors con-tain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/oroligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that usuallyoccur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and do notusually spread beyond the part of the brain where theyoriginate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composedof the highest-grade cells they contain.Non-glial brain tumorsThe most common brain tumors that do not developfrom glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, andSchwannomas.MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thoughtmedulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial cells.These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now believedto originate in developing cells not normally present inthe body after birth. They are sometimes called primitiveneurodectal tumors (PNET).MDL tumors are most common in children and aremore common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of MDLtumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually originatein the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controlscoordination and some muscle activity), and are oftencarried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid.MDL tumors rarely metastasize beyond the brain andspinal cord.
MENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which representmore than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate inthe membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and mostoften occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Menin-giomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimesbecome accustomed to their presence. Meningiomascompress, rather than invade, brain tissue and may growto be quite large before any symptoms appear.
SCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in theSchwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material thatprotects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing.These benign tumors are twice as common in women asin men, and are most often diagnosed in patients betweenthe ages 30-60.Schwannomas grow very slowly, and many peopleadapt to the slight hearing lossand balance problemsthat are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shapedSchwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear-ing in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on thenerves that control movement and feeling in the face, andcause headaches and facial numbness or tingling. Thepatient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or con-trolling eye movements, and the sense of taste can beaffected. A Schwannoma that grows large enough topress on the brainstem can be deadly.
CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors thatoccur in children are described as supratentorial (in theupper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in the lowestpart of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas arecommon supratentorial tumors. Infratentorial tumorsinclude medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and ependy-momas.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 570Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 570no evidence that head injurycauses brain tumors, butresearchers are trying to determine the relationship, ifany, between brain tumors and viruses, family history,and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields.Symptoms do not usually appear until the tumorgrows large enough to displace, damage, or destroy deli-cate brain tissue. When that happens, the patient mayexperience:• headaches that become increasingly painful and aremost painful when lying down• nausea and vomiting or sudden attacks of vomiting notaccompanied by nausea• seizures• dizziness, loss of coordination or balance• personality changes• sudden loss of vision• memory loss• speech problems• sensory changes• mental impairment• weakness or paralysison one side of the bodyA doctor should be notified whenever a patient expe-riences one or more of the symptoms.
Diagnosis
Although brain tumor symptoms resemble those ofmany other illnesses, the presence of a brain tumor maybe indicated by:• persistent headaches with vomiting or convulsions• progressive deterioration of sight, speech, hearing,touch; or deterioration in the ability to use an arm,hand, foot, or legWhen a patient experiences one or more of theabove symptoms, a primary care physician will performa complete physical examination, take a detailed med-ical history, and conduct a basic neurologic examinationto evaluate:• balance and coordination• abstract thinking and memory• eye movements• hearing, touch, and sense of smell• reflexes• control of facial muscles and movements of the headand tongue• awarenessIf the results of these examinations suggest a patientmay have a brain tumor, a neurologist recommends someor all of these additional diagnostic tests:• computed tomography scan (CT scan) to reveal brainabnormalities• magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tumorsbeneath the bones of the skull• complex imaging techniques such as Positron emis-sion tomography(PETscan), Single photon emissiontomography (SPECT scan)• electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electricalactivity in the brain• magnetoencephalography (MEG scan) to measure themagnetic fields produced by nerve cells and their elec-tric currents• x rays to reveal any distortion in the bones of the skull• angiography to outline a tumor and the blood vesselsthat lead to it• a brain scan to identify and record the location ofabnormal cells in the brain• radionuclide brain scintigraphy to view the capillariesfeeding the tumor after highlighting them with aradioactive substance

Treatment
Brain tumors are treated by multidisciplinary teamsof highly skilled specialists whose decisions are based on:• results of diagnostic tests• tumor size, position, and growth pattern• the patient’s health history and current medical status• the wishes of the patient and his familySurgerySurgery is the treatment of choice for accessiblebrain tumors, which can be removed without causingserious neurologic damage. The procedure most oftenperformed is a craniotomy, but the goals of any type ofbrain tumor surgery include:• removing as much of the tumor as possible (calleddebulking the tumor)• removing tumor tissue for microscopic analysis• allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor issituated and how it is growing• creating an entry channel for chemotherapydrugs andforms of radiation that are implanted in the brainDepending on the type of brain tumor, its location,and its size, a number of different techniques may beused to surgically remove it. Surgical techniques include:• classic operation• laser microsurgery (uses high temperatures to vaporizetumor cells• ultrasonic aspiration (uses ultrasound waves to break upthe tumor into smaller bits which can be “vacuumed”outBefore undergoing brain surgery, patients are oftengiven:• steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue• snticonvulsant medications to prevent or control seizures• radiation treatments to reduce tumor sizePatients whose benign brain tumors can be com-pletely removed may not require any additional treat-ment, but periodic physical and neurologic examinationsand CT or MRI scans are sometimes recommended todetermine whether the tumor has returned. Because sur-geons cannot be sure that every bit of an infiltrating ormetastasizing tumor has been removed, radiation andchemotherapy are used to eradicate cells that may haveescaped the scalpel.If a tumor cannot be completely removed, removinga portion of it (debulking) can alleviate the patient’ssymptoms, enhance the sense of well-being, and increasethe effectiveness of other treatments.Radiation therapyExternal radiotherapy, generally delivered on an out-patient basis, directs radiation to the tumor and the areaaround it. Implant radiation therapyinvolves placing tinypieces of radioactive material in the brain. Left in placepermanently, or for a short time, these radioactive pelletsrelease measured doses of radiation each day. This tech-nique is called brachytherapy. Patients are usually hospi-talized during the several days the pellets are most active.Stereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the patientwith a frame to stabilize the head, using imaging tech-niques to determine the exact location of tumor cells, andusing a sophisticated instrument to administer radiationprecisely to that point. Instruments used for delivery ofradiation include the gamma knife, adapted linear accel-erator (LINAC), and cyclotron.A variety of drugs may also be given during radia-tion therapy, to protect brain cells from the effects ofradiation (radioprotective drugs), to increase the sensitiv-ity of tumor cells to radiation (radiosensitizers), or toboost radiation’s effects (radioenhancers).ChemotherapyOne or more cancer-killing drugs may be taken bymouth or injected into a blood vessel, muscle, or the cere-brospinal fluid. Chemotherapy may be used with radia-tion and surgery as part of a patient’s initial treatment, orused alone to treat tumors that recur in the same place orin another part of the body. The usual chemotherapy regi-men for a brain tumor is a combination approach, mostcommonly using procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine.New methods of delivering chemotherapy are beingused as well. These include:• interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time ofsurgery. A chemotherapy-soaked wafer is placed in thecavity left after tumor removal.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 572Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 572• Intrathecal chemotherapy instills the medications rightinto the spinal fluid.• Intraarterial chemotherapy uses tiny catheter tubes todelivery high-dose chemotherapy directly into the arter-ies of the brain.• Potentially toxic chemotherapy drugs can be wrappedin special biologic envelopes called liposomes, to allowthe drugs to be delivered to the tumor without adverselyaffecting other healthy tissues along the way.• Electrochemotherapy uses electric voltage to transportchemotherapy agents into the brain.When a young child has a brain tumor, chemotherapyis often used to eliminate or delay the need for radiation.Other treatmentsIf a brain tumor cannot be cured, treatment isdesigned to make the patient as comfortable as possibleand preserve as much of his neurologic functioning aspossible. The patient’s doctor may prescribe:• analgesics to relieve pain• anticancer drugs to limit tumor growth• anticonvulsants to control seizures• steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissuePotential therapiesScientists are studying ways to empower chemother-apy drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (whichprotects the CNS by separating the brain from blood cir-culating throughout the body), and attack cancer cellsthat have infiltrated tissue inside it. Agents under investi-gation include both mannitol and substances calledreceptor-mediated permeabilizersBrain tumor researchers are also investigating:• Less invasive surgical procedures.• Monoclonal antibodies, which pair antibodies withradioactive substances. The antibodies are directed tofind and attach to tumor cells, at which time theradioactive substance kills the tumor cell.• Interleukin and interferon, which are substances pro-duced naturally by the human immune system whichseem to kill tumor cells. Scientists seek to producethese substances in the laboratory and incorporate theiruse in brain tumor treatment.• T-lymphocytes, which are also produced normally bythe human immune system, and are being used to injectdirectly into the tumor location during surgery and toinfuse into the bloodstream after surgery, in the hopesthat they will boost the immune system’s ability to fighttumor cells.• Tumor vaccines, which use elements of tumor cells tostimulate the patient’s immune system.• Methods of incorporating chemotherapy drugs intotumor cells to reduce the need for radiation.• Laboratory techniques that enable physicians to selectthe chemotherapy drugs most likely to kill particulartypes of tumors.• Gene therapy in which genetically engineered materialis transported to tumor cells by viruses that infect tumorcells and convert them to normal cells, stop theirgrowth, or kill them.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments have not been shown to curebrain tumors and should never be substituted for conven-tional therapy. However, complementary therapies (usedwith, not instead of, standard treatments) can help somepatients cope with the stressof their illness and sideeffects of their treatment.Biofeedbackcan teach patients to influence andcontrol heart rate, muscle tension, and other stress-relat-ed body functions. Some patients claim that guided imagery(visualization) helps them feel healthier andmore in control of their disease.Massage,meditation, and reflexologyhelp somepatients relax; while yogais said to soothe the body, spir-it, and mind. Hydrotherapyuses ice, liquid, and steamto improve circulation and relieve pain. Therapeutictouchpractitioners say they can relieve pain and othersymptoms by moving their hands in slow, rhythmicmotions several inches above the patient’s body.Botanical therapies, homeopathic treatment,tradi- tional Chinese medicinetreatments, nutritional focuseson diet and supplements, and detoxificationcan also beincorporated as complementary therapies.
Prognosis
The patient’s prognosis depends on where the tumoris located, what type of cells it contains, the size of thetumor, and the effect its already had on adjacent brainstructures. A patient whose tumor is discovered early andremoved completely may make a full recovery, but thesurgery itself can harm or destroy normal brain tissueand cause:• problems with thought, speech, and coordination• seizures• weakness• personality changes
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 573Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 573Although these post-operative problems may initial-ly be more severe than the symptoms produced by thetumor, they will probably diminish or disappear in time.Occupational therapy can teach patients and theirfamilies new ways to approach daily tasks. Physical ther-apy can benefit patients who have difficulty keeping theirbalance, expressing their thoughts, speaking, or swallow-ing. Children may need special tutors before and afterreturning to school. For patients who have incurablebrain tumors, hospice care may be available. Hospicesprovide a supportive environment and help patients man-age pain and remain comfortable.Consequences of radiation therapyCells killed by radiation can cluster in the brain,resembling tumors. They can cause headaches, seizures,and memory loss. Children treated with radiation maylose some of their eyesight and develop learning prob-lems. Radiation damage to the pituitary gland can hindernormal growth and development.Consequences of chemotherapySome drugs used to treat brain tumors can cause kid-ney damage and temporary or permanent tingling in thefingers and ringing in the ears.Inoperable tumorsBrain tumors that cannot be removed may causeirreversible brain damage and death.

Breast biopsy
Definition
A breast biopsy is removal of breast tissue for exam-ination by a pathologist. This can be accomplished surgi-cally, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.
Purpose
A biopsy is recommended when a significantabnormality is found, either on physical examinationand/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality caninclude a breast lump felt during physical self examina-tion or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test.Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to makesure that the threat of cancercannot be disproved orruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination. Alump may be obviously harmless when examined byultrasound. If this is not decisive, the presence of canceror a variety of benign breast conditions can be deter-mined using a biopsy.
Precautions
The type of biopsy recommended should be consid-ered. This will depend on whether the area can be felt,how well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasound,and how suspicious it feels or appears. Specializedequipment is needed for different types of biopsy andavailability may vary. Generally, needle biopsy is lessinvasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most,but not all situations. However, some surgeons feel it isfar less accurate.
Description
Surgical biopsyIf an abnormality is not felt during a self examina-tion, there are signs that indicate the need for medicalattention. These include:• severe breast pain• changes in the size of a breast or the nipple• changes in the shape of both breast or nipple• pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin• nipple redness, irritation, or inversion• changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface ofthe breast• some types of nipple dischargeIf the abnormality is not felt, a needle localizationmust be done before the actual surgery. After local anes-thetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the area ofconcern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used. Thepatient is awake and usually sitting up.There are two types of breast biopsy consideredhere, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is asurgical procedure, where the entire area of concern andsome surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually done asan outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free standingsurgery center. The patient may be awake, and is some-times given medication to make her drowsy. The area tobe operated on is numbed with local anesthetic. Infre-quently, general anesthesia is used.An excisional biopsy itself usually takes under onehour. The total amount of time spent at the facilitydepends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a needlelocalization was done, and the extent of the surgery.If a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may beperformed. In this case only a portion of the area isremoved and sent for analysis. The procedure is the sameas an excisional biopsy in other respects.Needle biopsyA needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious areafor examination. There are two types, aspiration biopsy(using a fine needle), and large core needle biopsy. Eitherof these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy. Per-cutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin.A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee-dle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied. It canbe done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. Localanesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as itmay be more painful than the biopsy needle. The area toplace the needle may be located by touch. No specializedequipment is needed. However, using ultrasound guid-ance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion atthe same time. The actual withdrawing of fluid and cellscan be visualized as it occurs. This helps ensure that thespecimen is taken from the right place.A large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameterneedle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size ofa grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital thathas the appropriate facilities. Local anesthetic is routine-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 575Breast biopsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 575ly used. Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of alarge core needle biopsy.If the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a stereo-tactic device is used. This means that x rays are taken fromseveral angles. This information is fed into a computer,which analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correctplace. The patient may be sitting up, or she may be lying onher stomach, with her breast positioned through an openingin the table. The breast is held firmly, but comfortablybetween a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to thoseused for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the frontand side of the breast). X rays may be taken before, during,and after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm thatthe correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may also bereferred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a mammotomy.Ultrasound is used to guide needle placement forsome lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After thearea is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician placesa transducer, an instrument about the size of an electricshaver, over the skin. This produces an image from thereflection of sound waves. A special needle, usually in aspring loaded device, is used to obtain the tissue. The pro-cedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening.
Preparation
A surgical breast biopsy may require the patient tohave nothing to eat or drink for a period of time beforethe operation. This will typically be from midnight thenight before, if general anesthesia is planned. No foodrestrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advis-able to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especiallyimportant if the patient will be lying on her stomach for astereotactic biopsy.Aftercare
After a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closedwith stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandagecan usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches aretaken out approximately one week afterward. Dependingon the extent of the operation, normal activities can beresumed in approximately one to three days. Vigorousexercisemay be limited for one to three weeks.The skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal. Itmay be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip, orcovered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage. Thepatient can return to her usual routine immediately afterthe biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not rec-ommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be removedone or two days after the biopsy.
Risks
Infection is always a possibility when the skin isbroken, although this rarely occurs. Redness, swelling, orsevere pain at the biopsy site would indicate a possible

Fine needle aspiration biopsy
A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to withdraw fluid and cells from the breast to be examined. An exci-sional biopsy is a surgical procedure in which the entire area of concern and some surrounding tissue is removed for analy-sis.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 576infection. Another possible consequence of a breast biop-sy is a hematoma. This is a collection of blood at thebiopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body.If it is very large and uncomfortable, it may need to bedrained. A surgical breast biopsy may produce a visiblescar on the breast. Sometimes this may make futuremammograms harder to interpret accurately.A false negative pathology report is another risk.This means that no cancer was found when a cancer waspresent. The incidence of this varies with the biopsytechnique. In general, fine needle aspiration biopsieshave the highest rate of false negative results, but theremay be variation in results between facilities.
Normal results
A normal pathology report indicates no malignancyis present. The tissue sample may be further classified asa benign breast condition, such as tumor of the breast(fibroadenoma) or connective tissue that resemblesfiber (fibrosis). Studies have demonstrated that approxi-mately 80% of all breast biopsies result in a benignpathology report.
Abnormal results
An abnormal pathology report indicates a cancer ispresent. If a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed,the pathologist has viewed individual cells under amicroscope to see if they appear cancerous. Large coreneedle biopsy and surgical biopsy will be able to givemore information. This includes the type of cancer,whether it has invaded surrounding tissue, and how likelyit is to spread quickly. There are some conditions whichare not malignant but indicate high risk for future devel-opment of breast cancer. If these are identified, morefrequent monitoring of the area may be recommended.Resources

Breast cancer
Definition
Breast canceris caused by the development ofmalignant cells in the breast. The malignant cells origi-nate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breast(ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer.Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled divisionleading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cellsto invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughoutthe body, in a process called metastasis.
Description
Breast cancer arises in the milk-producing glands ofthe breast tissue. Groups of glands in normal breast tis-sue are called lobules. The products of these glands aresecreted into a ductal system that leads to the nipple.Depending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of thebreast the cancer arises, it will develop certain character-istics that are used to sub-classify breast cancer intotypes. The pathologist will denote the subtype at the timeof evaluation with the microscope. Ductal carcinomabegins in the ducts, lobular carcinoma has a patterninvolving the lobules or glands. The more important clas-sification is related to the evaluated tumor’s capability to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 577Breast cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 577invade, as this characteristic defines the disease as a truecancer. The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ, meaning that the early malignancy has not yet becomecapable of invasion. Thus, ductal carcinoma in situ isconsidered a minimal breast cancer.How breast cancer spreadsThe primary tumor begins in the breast itself but onceit becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the breast tothe regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to otherorgan systems in the body and become systemic in nature.Lymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes the cellsthroughout the body. Lymph will work its way back to thebloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics.Along the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta-tions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes.Nearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph nodegroup filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes fromthat organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes areunder the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumorbegins in the breast and the first place to which it is likelyto spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as itinvades in its place of origin, may also work its way intoblood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, theblood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer tospread to other organs of the body.Breast cancer follows this classic progression thoughit often becomes systemic or widespread early in thecourse of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump inthe breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in sizeand contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that atumor of this size may take one to five years to develop.During that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spreadby lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body.When primary breast cancer spreads, it may first goto the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil-lary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If itproceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-bornespread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that mayinvolve a number of other organs in the body. Favoritesites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are thelung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turnsout, the presence of, and the actual number of, regionallymph nodes containing cancer remains the single bestindicator of whether or not the cancer has become widelymetastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in otherorgans may not be sensitive enough to reveal minutedeposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta-sis becomes very important in making treatment deci-sions for this disease.If breast cancer spreads to other major organs of thebody, its presence will compromise the function of thoseorgans. Deathis the result of extreme compromise ofvital organ function.
Demographics
Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she livesto be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she willdevelop the condition sometime during her life. As awoman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer risesdramatically regardless of her family history. The breastcancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less than 5% ofcases are discovered before age 35 and the majority of allbreast cancers are found in women over age 50.In 1999, there were 180,000 new cases of breast can-cer diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancereach year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by cancerin women. For the first time ever, mortality rates decreasedan average of 1.7% per year from 1995 through 1999, areflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies.
Causes and symptoms
There are a number of risk factors for the develop-ment of breast cancer, including:• family history of breast cancer in mother or sister• early onset of menstruation and late menopause• reproductive history: women who had no children orhave children after age 30 and women who have neverbreastfed have increased risk• history of abnormal breast biopsiesThough these are recognized risk factors, it is impor-tant to note that more than 70% of women who get breastcancer have no known risk factors. Having several riskfactors may boost a woman’s chances of developingbreast cancer, but the interplay of predisposing factors iscomplex. In addition to those accepted factors listedabove, some studies suggest that high-fat diets,obesity, or the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profile.Another factor that may contribute to a woman’s riskprofile is hormone replacement therapy(HRT).HRT provides significant relief of menopausalsymptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly pro-tection from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Howev- er, studies show that there is a small increased risk ofdeveloping breast cancer with HRT use. Thus, the use ofhormone replacement therapy should be based on per-sonal risk factors.Of all the risk factors listed above, family history isthe most important. In The Biological Basis of Cancer, the authors estimate that probably about half of all famil-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 578Breast cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 578ial breast cancer cases (families in which there is a highbreast cancer frequency) have mutations affecting thetumor suppressor gene BRCA-1. Another gene (BRCA-2) also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to early-onset breast cancers. However, breast cancer due toheredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases;only 5%–10% of all breast cancer cases will be womenwho inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev-ertheless, when the family history is strong for develop-ment of breast cancer, a woman’s risk is increased.Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common.Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast, fibro- cystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumpsin the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms ofpain, swelling, or discharge and may become evident tothe patient or physician as a lump that is either solid orfilled with fluid. Complete diagnostic evaluation of anysignificant breast abnormality is mandatory becausethough women commonly develop fibrocystic changes,breast cancer is common also, and the signs and symptomsof fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by thebiopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor-mality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal oftissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram isa low-dose, 2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) Thepatient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding alump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling,nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, thepatient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and alump is detected by the mammogram.When a patient has no signs or symptomsScreening involves the evaluation of women whohave no symptoms or signs of a breast problem, so whenthe screening mammogram leads to the evaluation, thepatient has no symptoms and may not have any abnor-mality on examination of the breast. Mammographyhas been very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one can-not identify on physical examination. However,10%–13% of breast cancer does not show up on mam-mography, and a similar number of patients with breastcancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normalphysical examination. These figures emphasize the needfor examination as part of the screening process.ScreeningIt is recommended that women get into the habit ofdoing monthly breast self examinations to detect anylump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump isfound, evaluation by an experienced physician and mam-mography is recommended. The American Cancer Soci-ety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use ofmammography on a screening basis. There has been con-troversy about the timing and appropriate frequency ofmammography when used as a screening tool, but theACS recommendations are as follows: Women shouldget annual mammograms after age 40. Those with a sig-nificant family history (one or more first-degree relativeswho have been treated for breast cancer), should startannual mammograms 10 years younger than theyoungest relative was when she was diagnosed, but notearlier than 35.Because of the greater awareness of breast cancer inrecent years, screening evaluations by examinations andmammography are performed much more frequently thanin the past. The result is that the number of breast cancersdiagnosed increased, but the disease is being diagnosed atan earlier stage than previously. The earlier the stage of

Skin dimpling, nip-ple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less fre-quent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though bloodynipple discharge is distressing, it is most often caused bybenign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple retraction in thepresence of an underlying breast mass on examination isa more advanced finding. Actual skin involvement, withedemaor ulceration of the skin, are late findings.A very common presenting sign is the presence of abreast lump. If the lump is suspicious and the patient hasnot had a mammogram by this point, a study should bedone on both breasts prior to anything else so that theoriginal characteristics of the lesion can be studied. Theopposite breast should also be evaluated mammographi-cally to determine if other problems exist that were unde-tected by physical examination.Whether an abnormal screening mammogram or oneof the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogramprompted suspicion, the diagnosis is established byobtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There are differenttypes of biopsy, each utilized with its own indicationdepending on the presentation of the patient. If signs ofwidespread metastasis are already present, biopsy of themetastasis itself may establish diagnosis.BiopsyDepending on the situation, different types of biopsymay be performed. The types include incisional and exci-sional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physiciantakes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy, themass is removed. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and coreneedle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies.
FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY. In a fine needleaspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed intothe lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the nee-dle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluation(cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple dischargecan have a sample taken of the discharge for cytologicalevaluation, also.) Fine needle aspiration is a simple pro-cedure that can be done under local anesthesia, and willtell if the lesion is a fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid.The sample obtained will yield much diagnostic informa-tion. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent tech-nique when the lump is palpable and the physician caneasily hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a sim-ple cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass willdisappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.Care must be taken, however, because if the mass is solidand the specimen is non-malignant, a complete removalof the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies are alsoobtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger pieceof tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may behelpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgicalremoval. An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarelyneeded for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. Ifthere remains question as to diagnosis, a complete opensurgical biopsy may be required.
EXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the excision-al, (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatientprocedure often done under local anesthesia.
NON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases,non-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammogra-phy are becoming more common. The use of x rays andcomputers to guide the needle for biopsy or to placemarkers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsyare commonly employed. Some benign lesions can befully removed by multiple directed core biopsies. Thesetechniques are very appealing because they are minimal-ly invasive; however, the physician needs to be careful toobtain a good sample.Other testsIf a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char-acteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilizedboth to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacua-tion. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guidefine needle or core biopsies of the breast.Computed tomography (CT scan, CAT scans), andmagnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), have only a veryoccasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions.
Treatment
StagingOnce diagnosis is established, before treatment isrendered, more tests are done to determine if the cancerhas spread beyond the breast. These tests include a chest x rayand blood countwith liver function tests. Along with the liver function measured by the blood sample, thelevel of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme from bone, isalso determined. A radionuclear bone scan may beordered. This test looks at the places in the body to whichbreast cancer usually metastasizes. A CT scan may alsobe ordered. The physician will do a careful examinationof the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasisbut unfortunately this exam is not very accurate. Since
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 580Breast cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 580the axillary node status is the best reflection of possiblewidespread disease, these nodes in part or all will beremoved at the time of surgical treatment.Using the results of these studies, clinical stage isdefined for the patient. This helps define treatment proto-col and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, orpathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymphnode status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail-able from the American Joint Commission on CancerManual and are generalized here:• Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) andno cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.• Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and thecancer has spread to the lymph nodes.• Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-er than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, whichhave grown into each other.• Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chestwall, along the breastbone.• Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodesbeyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.TreatmentSurgery, radiation, and chemotherapyare all uti-lized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on thestage, they will be used in different combinations orsequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the typeand stage of the disease being treated.
SURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of theentire breast and axillary contents along with the musclesdown to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera-py, (radical mastectomy). In the last twenty-five years,as it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys-temic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima-ry but of less and less magnitude.Today, surgical treatment is best thought of as acombination of removal of the primary tumor and stag-ing of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast isremoved along with the entire axillary contents, but themuscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radicalmastectomy has been performed.If the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size andlocated so that it can be removed without destroying areasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast,just the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will beremoved. The axillary nodes will still be removed forstaging purposes, usually through a separate incision.Because of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breasttissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of localrecurrence. This type of primary therapy is known aslumpectomy, (or segmental mastectomy), and axillarydissection.Currently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec-tion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy,a technique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drainthe tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam-pling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma thepatient experiences.When patients are selected appropriately based onthe preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgicalapproaches have been shown to produce similar results.In planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative thatthe operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance ofthe patient.The pathologic stage is determined after surgicaltreatment absolutely defines the local parameters. Inaddition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces-sary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling ofthe surgical specimen is thus very important. The tissueneeds to be analyzed for the presence or absence of hor-mone receptors and a receptor called HER-2. The pres-ence of these receptors will influence additional thera-

Microscopic evaluation may also include theassessment of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion asthese predict a worse outcome. The DNA of the tumorcells is quantitatively analyzed to help decide the biolog-ic aggressiveness of the tumor. These parameters will beutilized collectively along with the axillary lymph nodestatus to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the can-cer. This assessment, along with the age and general con-dition of the patient, will be considered when planningthe adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatmentsutilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that nomicroscopic disease exists and to help prolong patients’survival time.
RADIATION. Like surgical therapy,radiation thera-pyis a local modality—it treats the tissue exposed to itand not the rest of the body. Radiation is usually givenpost-operatively after surgical woundshave healed. Thepathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known andthis aids in treatment planning. The extent of the localsurgery also influences the planning. Radiation may notbe needed at all after modified radical mastectomy forstage I disease, but is almost always utilized when breast-preserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was exten-sive or if multiple nodes were involved, the field of tissueexposed will vary accordingly. Radiation is utilized as anadjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an importantmodality in gaining local control of the tumor. The use ofradiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvanttreatment. In the past, radiation was used as an alternativeto surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-pre-serving surgical protocols have been developed, primaryradiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performed.Radiation also has an important role in the treatment ofthe patient with disseminated disease, particularly if itinvolves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can effect paincontrol and prevention of fracture in this circumstance.
DRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularlythose originating in post-menopausal women, areresponsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors ontheir cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of primarytumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evalu-ation for the presence of these estrogen and progesteronereceptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, alteringthe hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumorgrowth and have a positive impact on survival. The drugtamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells sothat the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing,inhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptorspresent, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five yearsas an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonaltherapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they haveto be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evalu-ation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hor-mone environment are under study. Because of theseagents, there is rarely any need for surgical removal ofhormone-producing glands, such as the ovary or adrenal,that was sometimes necessary in the past.Shortly after the modified radical mastectomyreplaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgicaltreatment, it was appreciated that survival after localtreatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by theaddition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for aninterval of four to six months is now standard treatmentfor patients with stage II disease. The addition of sys-temic therapy to local treatment in patients who have noevidence of disease is performed on the basis that somepatients have metastasis that are not currently demonstra-ble because they are microscopic. By treating the wholepatient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, theadjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treat-ment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate,and 5-flourouracil, (CMF), is given for six months and iswell tolerated. The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (dox-orubicin), and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxicbut only requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxinmay also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) Thetwo methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvanthormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemo-therapy as they work through different routes.As one would expect, the encouraging results fromadjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the studyof similar therapy in stage I disease. The results are notas dramatic, but they are real. Currently, stage I disease isdivided into categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumorsize. Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adju-vant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly rec-ommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity ofthe treatment must be weighed individually for thepatient as patients with stage I disease have a survivor-ship of over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.If patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or, inspite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread dis-ease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a moreaggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con-taining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)have been found to be effective in inducing remission.On the basis of prognostic factors such as total num-ber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA with ahigh synthesis value, or aggressive findings on micro-scopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or III dis-ease can be predicted to do poorly. If their performancestatus allows, they can be considered for treatment withhighly aggressive chemotherapy. The toxicity is such thatbone marrow failure will result. To get around this antici-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 582Breast cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 582pated side effect of the aggressive therapy, either thepatients will be transplanted with their own stem cells,(the cells that will give rise to new marrow), or a tradi-tional bone marrow transplantationwill be required.This therapy can be a high-risk procedure for patients. Itis given with known risk to patients predicted to do poor-ly and then only if it is felt they can tolerate it. Mostpatients who receive this therapy receive it as part of aclinical trial. At present, it is unclear that such aggressivetherapy can be justified and it is under study.For patients who are diagnosed with advanced localdisease, surgery may be preceded with chemotherapyand radiation therapy. The disease locally regressesallowing traditional surgical treatment to those whocould not receive it otherwise. Chemotherapy and some-times radiation therapy will continue after the surgery.The regimens of this type are referred to as neo-adjuvanttherapy. This has been proven to be effective in stage IIIdisease. Neo-adjuvant therapy is now being studied inpatients with large tumors that are stage II in an effort tobe able to offer breast preservation to these patients.A drug known as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a mono-clonal antibody, is now being used in the treatment ofthose with systemic disease.

Prognosis
The prognosis for breast cancer depends on the typeand stage of cancer. Over 80% of stage I patients arecured by current therapies. Stage II patients survive over-all about 70% of the time, those with more extensivelymph nodal involvement doing worse than those withdisease confined to the breast. About 40% of stage IIIpatients survive five years, and about 20% of stage IVpatients do so.Coping with cancer treatmentSurgery for breast cancer is physically well-toleratedby the patient, especially those undergoing minimalsurgery in the axilla. Most patients can return to a normallifestyle within a month or so after surgery. Exercises canhelp the patient regain strength and flexibility. Arm,shoulder, and chest exercises help, and complete recov-ery of activity is to be expected.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 583Breast cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 583About 5-7% of patients undergoing complete axil-lary lymph node resection as part of their therapy maydevelop clinically significant lymphedema, or swellingin the arm on the side of involvement. If present, eleva-tion and massage may be needed intermittently. Thoughusually not serious, on occasion this complication mayinterfere with complete physical recovery. The incidenceof lymphedema is less with less axillary surgery. This isthe reason for the enthusiasm for sentinel node biopsy asthe surgical staging procedure in the axilla.It is common after breast cancer treatment to bedepressed or moody, to cry, lose appetite, or feel unwor-thy or less interested in sex. The breast is involved with awoman’s identity and loss of it may be disturbing. Forsome, counseling or a support group can help. Manywomen have found a support group of breast cancer sur-vivors to be an invaluable help during this stage. Involve-ment with volunteers from the local chapter of the Reachto Recovery program may be very helpful.Nearly all patients undergo some form of adjuvanttherapy for breast cancer. The magnitude of the toxicity ofthese adjuvant therapies is usually small and many patientsreceiving chemotherapy on this basis are capable of normalactivity during this time. Certainly, those who progress toadvanced disease are treated with more toxic chemothera-peutic regimens in an attempt to induce remission.Clinical trialsThe use of tamoxifen and other agents which alterthe hormone status of the patient are under study. TheNational Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project(NSABP) with support from the National Cancer Insti-tute began a study in 1992 (called the Breast Cancer Pre-vention Trial, or BCPT) studying the use of tamoxifen asa breast cancer preventative for high-risk women. Theresults yielded from the study showed that tamoxifen sig-nificantly reduced breast cancer risk, and the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration approved the use of tamoxifento reduce breast cancer risk for high-risk patients in1998. Another NSABP study, known as STAR, is seek-ing to understand if another drug, raloxifene, is as effec-tive as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in high-risk patients. That study was begun in 1999, and partici-pants are to be monitored for five years.Neo-adjuvant therapies to allow the use of breastpreservation in those with more advanced local diseaseare under investigation.Immune therapies have not been helpful to datethough there are vaccines being developed against pro-teins such as that produced by HER-2 that may be bene-ficial in the future.High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescueremains controversial. Factors can be identified that pre-dict certain patients will develop metastatic disease. Thistreatment has been offered to this select group of patientsbut the toxicity is such that defining a clear indication forthis treatment remains under study.
Prevention
As mentioned above, because of the results yieldedfrom the BCPT clinical trial, tamoxifen can now be pre-scribed to high-risk women to help prevent breast cancer.And, while most breast cancer can’t be prevented, itcan be diagnosed from a mammogram at an early stagewhen it is most treatable. The results of awareness androutine screening have allowed earlier diagnosis, whichresults in a better prognosis for those discovered.
Special Concerns
Though breast-preserving therapy is being done morefrequently than in years past, modified radical mastectomyremains an option when selecting therapy for the primarytumor. This option may allow treatment without radiationin earlier stage patients, or may be necessary if the presen-tation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation. Lossof the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treateddesire reconstruction of the breast. Breast reconstructionis performed either at the time of initial surgery (immedi-ate) or it may be delayed. Alternatives include placement ofimplants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the abdomenor back. Most agree that breast preservation gives superiorresults to any form of reconstruction. When the breast isremoved as part of primary therapy, these reconstructionsare available and do produce very reasonable results.Resources

Breast implants
Definition
Breast implantation is a surgical procedure forenlarging the breast. Breast-shaped sacks made of a sili-cone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline (saltwater), called implants, are used.
Purpose
Breast implantation is usually performed to makenormal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes. Sometimesa woman having a breast reconstructionafter a mastec- tomywill need the opposite breast enlarged to make thebreasts more symmetric. Breasts that are very unequal insize due to trauma or congenital deformity may also becorrected with an enlargement procedure.
Precautions
A woman in poor health or with a severe chronicdisease is not a good candidate for this procedure.
Description
A cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa-tient procedure. It may be done under local or generalanesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer-ence. The incision is made through the armpit, under thebreast, or around the areola (the darkened area aroundthe nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu-ous scars. The implant is placed between the breast tissueand underlying chest muscle, or under the chest muscle.The operation takes approximately one to two hours. Thecost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insur-

However, if enlargement is part of breast recon-struction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay forsome or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-$4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breastaugmentation or augmentation mammaplasty.
Preparation
Before the surgery is performed, the woman shouldhave a clear understanding of what her new breasts willlook like. She and her physician should agree about thedesired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to havethe patient review before and after pictures, to clarifyexpectations.
Aftercare
Driving and normal activities may be restricted forup to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,including vigorous exercise, in about three weeks. Thescars will be red for approximately one month, but willfade to their final appearance within one or two years.
Risks
Risks which are common to any surgical procedureinclude bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-pected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result indecreased sensation in the breast, or interference withbreast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficultto read and interpret mammograms, possibly delayingbreast cancerdetection. Also, the implant itself can rup-ture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor-mally forms around the implant, called a capsule, canbecome very hard. This is called capsular contracture,and may result in painand/or an altered appearance ofthe breast. The older the implant, the greater the chancesthat these problems will occur.There has been intermittent publicity about possiblehealth risks from breast implants. Most concerns havefocused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use ofthis type of implant, and ordered further studies. Todayonly saline-filled implants are used for cosmetic breastsurgery. Recent studies have shown no evidence long-term health risks from silicone implants. However,research on the possible links between these implants andautoimmune or connective tissue diseases is continuing.

Breast reconstruction
Definition
Breast reconstruction is a series of surgical proce-dures performed to recreate a breast. Reconstructions arecommonly done after one or both breasts are removed asa treatment for breast cancer. Also, a breast may need tobe refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma orabnormalities that occur during breast development.
Purpose
Many authorities consider reconstruction an integralpart of the therapy for breast cancer. A breast thatappears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normal-cy, which can aid in the psychological recovery frombreast cancer. It eliminates the need for an external pros-thesis (false breast), which many women find physicallyuncomfortable as well as inconvenient.
Precautions
Not all women are good candidates for breast recon-struction. Overall poor physical health, or specific prob-lems such as cigarette smoking,obesity, high bloodpressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of compli-cations. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged recovery peri-od or failure of the reconstruction may be a result. Awoman’s physical ability to cope with major surgery andrecuperation also need to be considered.
Description
Breast reconstruction is done in two stages, with theultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and feelsas natural as possible. It is important to remember that
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 586Breast reconstructionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 586while a good result may mimic a normal breast closely,there will inevitably be scars and loss of sensation. Thereconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original.The first step is to form a structure called a breastmound. This can be accomplished using artificial materialscalled breast implants, or by using tissues from other partsof the woman’s body. The second step involves creating abalance between the newly constructed breast and thebreast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex(darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual-ly done several months after the mound is created, to allowswelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary,such as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or makingit larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.Timing, immediate or delayed reconstructionWhile immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom-mended for women with breast cancer who need to under-go other, more important treatments, breast reconstructioncan be done almost anytime. It even can be done during thesame procedure as the mastectomy, or it can be delayed.There are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to returnto normal activities and routines is often enhanced whenreconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. Abetter appearance may result from IR. There is less skinremoval, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon isbetter able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast,so it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely.The cost of IR is generally lower than the cost ofdelayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-tion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for acombined procedure than for two separate surgeries.There are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgeryitself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.Post-operative painand recovery time will be greaterthan for mastectomy alone.Other authorities contend that delayed reconstruc-tion (DR) offers different physical and psychologicaladvantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alonetakes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and lesspain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more timeto adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additionaltherapy. She is better able to research her options, and toformulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon-structive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR,the patient can donate her own blood ahead of time(autologous transfusion), and/or arrange to have familyand friends donate blood for her use (directed donation).The psychological stressof living without a breast isa disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entailsresults in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster,an additional recuperation period is required after thedelayed operation.Type of reconstructionThere are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-tion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant orthe breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis-sues (autologous reconstruction).
ARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce-dures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo-gous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They aremade of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth ortextured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (saltwater), or a combination of both.An implant may be a fixed volume type, which can-not change its size. Implants that have the capacity to befilled after insertion are called tissue expanders. Thesemay be temporary or permanent.The initial procedure for any implant insertion usesthe mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu-ally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas-tectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose,or a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant isinserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as neededand stitched closed.If there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size,or a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander isused. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with anattached valve or port through which saline can be injected.After the initial surgical incision is healed, the womanreturns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weeklybasis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injectionscan continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferredsize is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and laterpartially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result.A temporary tissue expander will be removed after severalmonths and replaced with a permanent implant.IR surgery using an implant takes approximatelytwo to three hours, and usually requires up to a three dayhospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR,takes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as anoutpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization.
AUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap andfree flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissueis used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus-cle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi-nal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon-struction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour-ishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. Thesecond kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also usesskin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 587Breast reconstructionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 587attaches them to other vessels where the new breast is tobe created. The surgeon uses a microscope to accomplishthis delicate task of sewing blood vessels together. Some-times the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flapprocedures. Either type of surgery may also be called amyocutaneous flap, referring to the skin and muscle used.The skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc-tion can come from one of several possible places on thebody, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or “tummytuck”), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the buttocks(gluteus maximus free flap).Finishing the reconstructionOther procedures may be necessary to achieve the goalof symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to make theopposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction),or higher (mastopexy). These, or any other refinementsshould be completed before the creation of a nipple andareola. Tissue to form the new nipple may come from thereconstructed breast itself, the opposite breast, or a moredistant donor site, such as the inner thigh or behind the ear.The nipple and areolar construction is usually an outpatientprocedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, istattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the color ofthe opposite nipple and areola as closely as possible.InsuranceInsurance coverage for breast reconstruction varieswidely. Some policies will allow procedures on the affect-ed breast, but refuse to pay for alterations to the opposite

Latissimus dorsi procedure
TRAM flap procedure
Breast reconstruction surgery may be performed by inserting an artificial substance, or implant, to replace breast tissue.Autologous reconstruction, in which a woman’s own tissues are used, includes the latissimus dorsi flap, where skin andmuscle taken from the back is rotated around to the breast area, and the TRAM flap, in which abdominal fat and muscle aretunneled under the skin to the breast area. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 588breast. Other plans may cover the cost of an external pros-thesis, or reconstructive surgery, but not both. As of Janu-ary 1998, 25 states had different laws regarding requiredinsurance coverage for post mastectomy reconstruction.Implants may pose additional insurance concerns.Some companies will withdraw coverage for womenwith implants, or add a disclaimer for future implant-related problems. Careful reading of insurance policies,including checking on the need for pre-approval and/or asecond opinion, is strongly recommended.
Preparation
Routine preoperative preparations, such as takingnothing to eat or drink the night before surgery are need-ed for reconstructive procedures. Blood transfusions areoften necessary for autologous reconstructive surgeries.The patient may donate her own blood, and/or have fami-ly and friends donate several weeks before the surgery.Emotional preparation is also important. Breastreconstruction will not resolve a psychological problemthe woman had before mastectomy, nor make an unstablerelationship strong. An expectation of physical perfectionis unrealistic. A woman who cites any of these reasonsfor reconstruction shows that she has not been adequate-ly informed or prepared. Complete understanding of thebenefits and limitations of this surgery is necessary for asatisfactory result.
Aftercare
The length of the hospital stay, recovery period, andfrequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies consid-erably with the different kinds of reconstruction. In general,autologous procedures require longer hospitalization andrecovery time than implant procedures. Bandages anddrainage tubes remain in place for at least a day for all surg-eries. Microsurgical or free flaps are most closely moni-tored in the first day or two after surgery. The circulation tothe breast may be checked as often as every hour. Completebreast reconstruction requires at least one additionalsurgery to create a nipple and areola. Scars may remain redand raised for a month or longer. The true, final appearanceof the breasts will not be visible for at least one year.
Risks
Some women have reported various types of autoim-mune related connective-tissue disorders, which theyattribute to their implants usually involving silicone gelimplants. Lawsuits have been filed against the manufac-turers of implants. Food and Drug Administration guide-lines, issued in 1992, now limit their use to women whoneed to replace an existing silicone gel-filled implant,KEY TERMS
Autologous—From the same person. An autolo-gous breast reconstruction uses the woman’s owntissues. An autologous blood transfusion is bloodremoved then transfused back to the same personat a later time.Capsular contracture—Thick scar tissue around abreast implant, which may tighten and cause dis-comfort and/or firmness.Flap—A section of tissue moved from one area ofthe body to another.Free flap—A section of tissue detached from itsblood supply, moved to another part of the body,and reattached by microsurgery to a new bloodsupply.Mastopexy—Surgical procedure to lift up a breast.May be used on opposite breast to achieve sym-metrical appearance with a reconstructed breast.Pedicle flap—Also called an attached flap. A sec-tion of tissue, with its blood supply intact, which ismaneuvered to another part of the body.have had surgery for breast cancer, or have a medicalcondition which results in serious breast abnormality. Inaddition, patients must sign a consent form which detailsthe potential risks of silicone gel-filled implants, andbecome enrolled in a long range study. Saline filledimplants are permitted for all uses, although manufactur-ers must collect data on possible risks.The FDA issued a status report on Breast ImplantSafety in 1995, and revised it in March 1997. It notedthat studies so far have not shown a serious increase inthe risk of recognized autoimmune diseases in womenwith silicone gel-filled breast implants. It also addressedconcerns about other complications and emphasized theneed for further study of this issue.There are a number of risks common to any surgicalprocedure such as bleeding, infection, anesthesia reac-tion, or unexpected scarring. Hematoma (accumulationof blood at the surgical site), or seroma (collection offluid at the surgical site) can delay healing if not drained.Any breast reconstruction also poses a risk of asymmetryand/or the need for unplanned surgical revision. Persis-tent pain is another potential complication possible withall types of breast reconstruction.Implants have some unique problems that maydevelop. A thick scar, also called a capsule, forms around

Capsular contracture occurs when thescar becomes firm or hardened. This may cause painand/or change the texture and appearance of the breast.Implants can rupture and leak, deflate, or become dis-placed. The chances of capsular contracture or ruptureincrease with the age of the implant. These complica-tions can usually be remedied with outpatient surgery toloosen the capsule or remove and/or replace the implantas needed. There is some evidence that using implantswith textured surfaces may decrease the incidence ofthese problems. An implant tends to remain firm indefi-nitely. It will not grow larger or smaller as the woman’sweight changes. Asymmetry can develop if a womangains or loses a large amount of weight.The autologous procedures all carry a risk of flapfailure—loss of blood supply to the tissue forming thenew breast. If a large portion of the flap develops inade-quate blood supply, another reconstructive techniquemay be necessary. TRAM flap procedures can result indecreased muscle tone and weakness in the abdomenand/or abdominal hernia. Arm weakness may occur afterlatissimus dorsi flap surgery.
Normal results
A normal result of breast reconstruction depends onthe woman’s goals and expectations. It will not be thesame as the breast it replaces. In general, it should be sim-ilar in size and shape to the opposite breast, but will haveless sensation and be less mobile than a natural breast. Areconstruction using implants will usually be firmer androunder than the other breast. It may feel cooler to touch,depending on the amount of tissue over it. Scars areunavoidable, but should be as unobtrusive as possible.Resources

Breast reduction
Definition
Breast reduction is a surgical procedure performedin order to decrease the size of the breasts.
Purpose
Women with very large breasts (macromastia ormammary hyperplasia) seek breast reduction for relief ofpainin the back, shoulder, and neck. They may also feeluncomfortable about their breast size and have difficultyfinding clothing that will fit properly. Additionally, breastreduction may be needed after reconstructive surgery fol-lowing the surgical removal of cancerous breast tissue(mastectomy), to make the breasts more symmetric.Men who have enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) may also be candidates for breast reduction. However, excessivealcohol intake,smoking marijuana, or using anabolicsteroids may cause gynecomastia, and surgery is not rec-ommended for men who continue to use these products.
Precautions
Breast reduction is not recommended for womenwhose breasts are not fully developed or who plan tobreast feed.
Description
Breast reduction may also be called reductionmammaplasty. It is most often done in the hospital, undergeneral anesthetic. However, studies have suggested thatan outpatient procedure, using local anesthetic and mildsedationmay be appropriate for some patients. Theoperation takes approximately two to four hours. Themost commonly made incision encircles the areola (dark-ened area around the nipple) and extends downward andaround the underside of the breast. This produces theleast conspicuous scar. The excess tissue, fat, and skinare removed, and the nipple and areola are repositioned.In certain cases,liposuction(fat suctioning) is used to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 590Breast reductionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 590remove extra fat from the armpit area. A hospital stay ofup to three days may be needed for recovery.If deemed medically necessary, breast reduction iscovered by some insurance plans. However, a specifiedamount of breast tissue may need to be removed in orderto qualify for coverage. Surgeon’s fees range from$4,800-$6,500 and up.
Preparation
Consultation between surgeon and patient is impor-tant to ensure that the woman understands and agreeswith the expected final results of the procedure. Mea-surements and photographs may be taken. Many doctorsalso recommend a mammogram before the operation, tomake sure there is no cancer.
Aftercare
After the surgery, an elastic bandage or special support-ive bra is placed over gauze bandages and drainage tubes.The bandages and tubes are removed in a day or two. Thebra will need to be worn around the clock for several weeks.Stitches are removed one to three weeks after the operation.Normal activities, including sexual relations may be restrict-ed for several weeks. Scars will typically remain red, andperhaps lumpy for up to several months, but will graduallyfade and become less noticeable. It may take up to a yearbefore the breasts achieve their final position and size.
Risks
Risks common to any operation include bleeding,infection, anesthesia reactions, or unexpected scarring.Breast reduction may result in decreased feeling in thebreasts or nipples and/or impaired ability to breastfeed.When healing is complete, the breasts may be slightlyuneven, or the nipples may be asymmetric.
Normal results
Smaller breast size should be achieved, and withthat, the accompanying pain and discomfort should bealleviated.KEY TERMS
Gynecomastia—Overly developed or enlargedbreasts in a male.Macromastia—Excessive size of the breasts.Mammary hyperplasia—Increased size of thebreast.ResourcesBOOKS

Breast self-examination
Definition
A breast self-examination (BSE) is an inspection bya woman of her breasts to detect breast cancer.
Purpose
A BSE is one of three tests the American Cancer Society recommends to help detect breast cancer in itsearliest stages. By regularly examining her own breasts, awoman is more likely to find any changes that may haveoccurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a weekafter a woman’s period ends, when her breasts are not ten-der or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSEshould be completed on the same day every month. ABSE should also be regularly completed by women whoare pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants. By combining a BSE with a mammographyand clinicalbreast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu-nity for reducing chances of deathfrom breast cancerthrough early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancersare found through a BSE. The American Cancer Societyrecommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com-plete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anythingsuspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully ina mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling,puckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple.
Description
To complete a monthly BSE:• When lying down, place a pillow under the right shoul-der and position the right arm behind the head. Usingthe finger pads of the three middle fingers on the lefthand, check the entire breast area. Use small circles andfollow an up-and-down pattern while pressing firmlyenough to know how the breast feels from month tomonth. This exam should then be repeated on the left
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 591Breast self-examinationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 591breast using the finger pads of the right hand with thepillow under the left shoulder.• When standing before a mirror, any changes in theshape or look of the breasts should be checked. In orderto look for any skin or nipple changes such as dimplingor nipple discharge, the arms should first be placed atthe sides and then overhead. Hands are then placedfirmly on hips to flex chest muscles, and then the bodyshould be bent forward.• When taking a shower, the right arm should be raised.By using soapy hands and fingers flat the right breastand outer part of the breast can be examined. The samesmall circles and up-and-down pattern used when lyingdown should be used in an upright position. Repeat onthe left breast.
Preparation
Before beginning a monthly BSE, a woman’s breastsshould be completely exposed.
Normal results
Each woman’s breasts has their own normal lookand feel. By completing a BSE each month, a woman candetermine what is normal for her and check for changesthat may arise. A regular pattern of lumpiness in thebreasts is normal.
Abnormal results
If any changes are noticed during a monthly BSE,such as a new, hard lump in the breast or underarms, adoctor should examine the area immediately. Other trou-ble signs that should not be ignored include:• change in breast size or shape• dimpling or puckering of the skin• redness, swelling, or warmth that does not go away•a  painin one area that does not vary with a woman’smonthly cycle• a nipple that pulls in• discharge from the nipple that begins suddenly andappears only in one breast• one nipple that has an itchy, sore, or scaling areaBeth A.

Breast sonogram seeBreast ultrasound
Breast ultrasound
Definition
Breast ultrasound (or sonography) is an imagingtechnique for diagnosing breast disease, such as cancer. It uses harmless, high frequency sound waves to form animage (sonogram). The sound waves pass through thebreast and bounce back or echo from various tissues toform a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasiveand involves no radiation.
Purpose
Breast ultrasound may be used in several ways. Themost common application is to investigate a specific areaof the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpablelump and/or a lump or density discovered by x ray(mammogram) can be further evaluated by ultrasound. Itis especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid-filled cyst and a solid mass. It can also identify smalllesions that are too tiny to be felt.Breast ultrasound is often the first study performed toevaluate masses in women under 35 whose mammogramscan be difficult to interpret due to the density of theirbreast tissue. The lack of radiation used with ultrasoundmakes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in womenwho are pregnant. Assessing breast implantsfor leakageor rupture is another way ultrasound is used. Breastinflammation, where pockets of infection or abscessesmay form, can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound.Thickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign ofinflammatory breast cancer. Ultrasound can sometimesidentify a cancerous growth within the breast causing thethickened skin. These cases are usually followed by acore biopsy guided by ultrasound (described below).Breast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide aneedle for several interventional procedures. These includecyst aspiration, fine needle aspiration, large core needle
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 592Breast ultrasoundGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 592biopsy (as a first step in determining treatment for a lesionthat is likely to be cancerous), and needle localization insurgical breast biopsy. Biopsies guided by ultrasound havedistinct advantages. The ultrasound guides the needle sothat a lesion can be removed for the biopsy. Patients usuallyfind that the procedure is less traumatic and more comfort-able than surgical biopsies. Ultrasound is known for itsaccuracy in determining how far a cancerous growthextends into the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot befelt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less costlythan surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the abnormality thatrequires biopsy can be seen on both a mammogram andultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is often morecomfortable for the patient as no compression is necessary.
Description
Ultrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or anoth-er outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center.The patient removes her clothing from the waist upand puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She lieson her back or side on an examining table. A gel thatenhances sound transmission is spread over the area to beexamined. The technologist then places a transducer, aninstrument about the size of an electric shaver, againstthe skin. The images from reflected sound waves appearon a monitor screen.A good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if thepatient is unable to remain quietly in one position. Obe- sitymay hinder clear viewing of internal structures, andthe accuracy of an ultrasound study is highly dependenton the skill of the person performing the examination.The images recorded vary with the angle and pressure ofthe transducer and the equipment settings. The examina-tion may take from 30 to 45 minutes. Most insuranceplans cover the cost of an ultrasound examination.
Normal results
An ultrasound examination may reveal either normaltissue or a benign condition such as a cyst. Ultrasoundcan confidently diagnose a benign structure that has cer-tain characteristics of a simple cyst. In the case of a sim-ple cyst with no symptoms, additional treatment beyondcontinued observation is usually not needed.
Abnormal results
A potentially malignant mass can be identified bybreast ultrasound. Abnormal results fall into the following
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 593Breast ultrasound

Cyst—A thin-walled, fluid-filled benign structurein the breast.Ductal carcinoma—A type of cancer thataccounts for as much as 80% of breast cancers.These tumors feel bigger than they look on ultra-sound or mammogram.Fibroadenoma—A benign breast growth made upof fibrous tissue. It is the most common mass inwomen under 35 years of age, and is found inboth breasts in 3% of cases.Infiltrating lobular carcinoma—A type of cancerthat accounts for 8% to 10% of breast cancers. Inbreasts that are especially dense, ultrasound canbe useful in identifying these masses.Microcalcifications—Tiny flecks that are too smallto be felt. They are important markers of cancerthat show up on ultrasound and mammogram.Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma—A type of cancerthat accounts for 1% to 2% of breast cancers.Resembles medullary carcinoma in ultrasound andmammogram, but usually affects older women.Nonpalpable—Cannot be felt by hand. In cancer,growths that are nonpalpable are too small to befelt, but may be seen on ultrasound or mammo-gram.Papillary carcinoma—A type of breast cancer thatprimarily occurs in older women. On ultrasound,this type of tumor may look like a solid or com-plex mass, or it may show up as solid tissue pro-truding into a cyst.Tubular carcinoma—A type of cancer that accountsfor approximately 1% to 2% of breast cancers. Canappear small on ultrasound or mammogram.GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 593categories: benign fibrous nodule, complex cyst, suspi-cious lesion, and lesion highly suggestive of cancer. Incases where ultrasound shows the presence of a complexcyst or fibrous nodule, a biopsy is justified because 10% to15% of these growths are malignant. Lesions falling intothe last two categories (suspicious or highly suggestive ofcancer) have a higher chance of being cancerous, andshould be investigated further, either by biopsy or surgery.Breast cancers such as the following may be identifiedon ultrasound: ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carci-noma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous (colloid) carcino-ma, tubular carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. On ultra-sound, the shape of a lesion and the type of edges it has cansometimes indicate if it is benign or cancerous, but thereare exceptions. For example, benign fibroadenomas areusually oval, and some cancers can be similarly shaped.Cancerous tumors usually have jagged edges, but somebenign growths can have these edges as well. Ultrasound isnot a definitive test. Tissue diagnosis is often required.Resources

Breech birth
Definition
Breech birth is the delivery of a fetus (unborn baby)hind end first. Between 3-4% of fetuses will start labor in thebreech position, which is a potentially dangerous situation.Description
Throughout most of pregnancy, the developingfetus is completely free to move around within theuterus. Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large thatmovement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus toturn over, so whatever position it has assumed by thispoint is likely to be the same position that he or she willbe in when labor begins.For reasons that are not fully understood, almost allunborn babies settle into a head down position. The fetusis upside down in the uterus, and the head will lead theway during the birth process.Unfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate. Mostof these are in the breech position. The buttocks lead theway out of the uterus, and the legs are folded in front ofthe body (frank breech). Delivery from the breech posi-tion poses far more risks than delivery head first (vertexposition).The biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually itshead. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, thenthe rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily. Ifthe fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that the bodywill fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the baby’s headwill get stuck at the level of the chin. This condition,known as a trapped head, is very dangerous.When the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance to“mold” during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull arenot yet fastened together the way they are in a child oradult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s skullcan move. During the long hours of labor the skull canchange shape to fit through the pelvis more easily, whichis why many babies are born with a “cone head”. If thebaby is born from the breech position, the skull does nothave a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis, and it iseven more likely to get stuck.If the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility ofinjury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilicalcord usually stops pulsating (just as it would during a nor-mal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen supply from themother to the baby. If the baby’s head is still inside theuterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own. Therefore,it is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible.The life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s headcan cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting inpermanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby can-not be delivered within a few minutes, the baby mightdie. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech deliverywith a trapped head.Of course, many babies are safely delivered from thebreech position. There are certain factors that make abreech delivery more likely to be successful: if ultra-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 594Breech birthGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 594sound (a technique that uses sound waves to visualize thefetus) shows that the fetus is in the frank breech position,the fetus’s head is tucked on its chest, and the fetus is notbig, it is less likely that its head will get stuck.Among breech babies born after the full nine-monthterm, smaller babies usually do better. This is not true forpremature babies. Premature babies are more likely to havea trapped head because the body of a premature baby isusually much smaller than his or her head. Prematurebabies are generally not delivered from the breech position.The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided bydelivering the baby through a surgical procedure ( cesarean section, also known as c-section). For the past twentyyears, cesarean section has been recommended when thefetus is breech. More recently, many providers have offeredthe option of version, attempting to turn the fetus within theuterus to a head first position before labor begins.Version is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus inthe breech position does a somersault, it will end up headdown. During a version, the obstetrician tries to make thefetus do a somersault.A version should only be done in a hospital, with anultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician inturning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with afetal monitor before and after the version. Some obstetri-cians give the mother an injection of medication to relaxthe mother’s uterus and prevent any contractions.During the procedure, the obstetrician places his orher hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the location ofthe unborn baby’s buttocks and head. The buttocks arelifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the baby’shead to encourage him to perform a somersault. It maytake several tries before the fetus cooperates, but overhalf will eventually turn.A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is inthe breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can only betried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is notlying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord doesnot appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of breech birth is not known. There aregenerally no identifiable symptoms. However, somewomen can tell the position of the fetus by where theyfeel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell whatposition the fetus is in at any given moment.
Diagnosis
A health care provider can often tell the position ofthe fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mother’sabdomen. Another clue to the position is the locationwhere the heartbeat is heard best. If the fetus’s heartbeatis best heard below the level of the mother’s navel, it islikely to be positioned head first. On the other hand, ifthe heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel, itis likely to be breech.The only way to really be sure, however, is to do anultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very easy totell the position of the fetus.Treatment
If a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks ofpregnancy, there are three possible courses of action: Cesare-an section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery.Cesarean section is the most common way to delivera breech baby. This surgical procedure carries more riskfor the mother, but many women prefer to take the risk ofsurgery on themselves rather than let the baby face therisks of breech delivery.Version is gaining in popularity. Version is a medicalprocedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn thebreech fetus to the head first position. Version is success-ful more than 50% of the time. However, some babieswho are successfully turned will turn back to the breechposition after the procedure is done.

Breech Birth
Approximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech(buttocks first) position. While this is a potentially danger-ous situation, many full-term babies can be safely deliveredfrom the breech position.(Illustration by Electronic IllustratorsGroup.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 595Some women choose breech vaginal delivery. Thisshould only be attempted if ultrasound shows that thefetus is in a favorable breech position. Most babies willdo very well during a breech delivery, but it is alwayspossible that the fetus will be injured, perhaps seriously.
Prevention
There is no way to prevent a fetus from settling intothe breech position at the end of pregnancy. A womanwho has had one breech fetus is more likely than averageto have another.Amy B. Tuteur, MDResources

Bronchiectasis
Definition
Bronchiectasis is a condition in which an area of thebronchial tubes is permanently and abnormally widened(dilated), with accompanying infection.
Description
The bronchial tubes are the networks of branchingtubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs (alve-oli). In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi isunusually large. Examination of the walls of the bronchialtubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements,with replacement by scar tissue. Pus collects within thebronchi, and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs, andcarbon dioxide out of the lungs (air exchange) is impaired.The bronchi show signs of inflammation, with swellingand invasion by a variety of immune cells. The inflamedareas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels. Thearea of the lung which should be served by a diseasedbronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infection.Causes and symptoms
Prior to the widespread use of immunizations,bronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infectionwith either measlesor whooping cough. Currently,viruses that cause influenza(flu) or influenza-like syn-dromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede thedevelopment of bronchiectasis. Patients who have beeninfected with tuberculosisor the virus which causesAIDS(HIV or human immunodeficiencyvirus) alsohave an increased chance of bronchiectasis.A number of pre-existing conditions may cause anindividual to be more susceptible than normal to infec-tion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.These conditions include disorders of cilia, and immunedisorders.Cilia are the tiny hairs which usually line thebronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping thebronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders, andcleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum) whichmay be produced by the bronchi. When these cilia areabnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial or viralinvaders may remain in the respiratory tract, multiply,and cause serious infections.Immune disorders include decreased production ofcertain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins) whichusually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viralinvasion. When these immunoglobulins are not producedin large enough quantity, bacterial and viral invaders arenot effectively killed off, and infection occurs.Other causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal-ly blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to tumorgrowth within the bronchial tube, or due to a child acci-dentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off thebronchial tube. People with the disease called cystic fibrosis(CF) often have their bronchial tubes obstructedby the thick, sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CF.Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) canharm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis. An extremeallergic response of the immune system to the presenceof certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus) can also damage the bronchial tubes enough to result inbronchiectasis.Symptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough and the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mix-ture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In somecases, there may be wheezingand shortness of breath. The constant, low-level of infection may flare, resultingin increased production of sputum, worsening of thecough, and fever. The area of the lung served by theaffected bronchial tube may become severely infected,resulting in pneumonia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 596BronchiectasisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 596Diagnosis
Chest x raymay reveal evidence of bronchiectasis,and CT scans are particularly good at revealing the thick,dilated bronchial walls of bronchiectasis. Sputum willneed to be collected and cultured (grown in a laboratorydish), in order to examine it microscopically for the spe-cific type of organism responsible for infection. A carefulsearch for other underlying diseases is important, look-ing in particular for ciliary abnormalities, cystic fibrosis,or immunoglobulin deficiencies.
Treatment
Treatment should involve efforts to resolve anyunderlying disorder. Infections will require antibiotics, obstruction may require the removal of a foreign object ortumor. Medications are available to help thin the sputum,so that it can be more effectively coughed up. Rhythmicclapping on the chest and back, while the patient assumesa number of positions (head down, primarily), may helpthe lungs to drain more effectively. This is called chest physical therapy, or percussion and postural drainage.When a particular area of the lung is constantly andseverely infected, surgery may be needed to remove it. Whenbleeding occurs from irritated bronchial tubes and over-grown bronchial blood vessels, surgery may be requiredeither to remove an area of the bronchial tube, or to inject thebleeding blood vessel with a material to stop the bleeding.In some patients, bronchiectasis eventually leads to aconstantly low level of blood oxygen, despite other treat-ments. These patients usually have an associated increasein the size of the right side of their hearts, along with adecrease in the heart’s ability to pump blood through thelungs. Some patients with extremely severe symptoms anddisability have been treated with lung transplantation.Prognosis
Prognosis varies widely, depending on how wide-spread or focal the bronchiectasis, and the presence ofother underlying disorders.Resources

Bronchi—The network of tubular passages whichcarry air to the lung and allow air to be expelledfrom the lungs.Cilia—Hair-like projections which line thebronchial tubes (also present in other areas of thebody). Normal cilia beat consistently, sweepingthe bronchi clean of bacteria, viruses, and mucus.GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 597trachea and the larger air tubes of the lung that bring air infrom the trachea (bronchi). Bronchitis can either be ofbrief duration (acute) or have a long course (chronic).Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, butcan also be caused by a bacterial infection and can healwithout complications. Chronic bronchitis is a sign of seri-ous lung disease that may be slowed but cannot be cured.
Description
Although acute and chronic bronchitis are bothinflammations of the air passages, their causes and treat-ments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent inwinter. It usually follows a viral infection, such as a coldor the flu, and can be accompanied by a secondary bacter-ial infection. Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeks,although the coughmay persist longer. Acute bronchitis,like any upper airway inflammatory process, can increasea person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia.Anyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, youngchildren, and the elderly are more likely to get the dis-ease because people in these age groups generally haveweaker immune systems. Smokers and people with heartor other lung diseases are also at higher risk of develop-ing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed to chemicalfumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greaterchance of developing acute bronchitis.Chronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability anddeathin the United States. The American Lung Associa-tion estimates that about 14 million Americans sufferfrom the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic bronchi-tis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by cough-ing and spitting up of phlegm. In chronic bronchitis,these symptoms are present for at least three months ineach of two consecutive years.Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchialirritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently, moremen than women developed chronic bronchitis, but asthe number of women who smoke has increased, so hastheir rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease pro-gresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are morelikely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.Chronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases thatfall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD). Other diseases in this category includeemphysemaand chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronicbronchitis may progress to emphysema, or both diseasesmay be present together.
Causes and symptoms
Acute bronchitisAcute bronchitis usually begins with the symptomsof a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and dry cough.However, the cough soon becomes deep and painful.Coughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum.These symptoms may be accompanied by a feverof up to 102°F (38.8°C). Wheezingafter coughing is common.In uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever andmost other symptoms, except the cough, disappear afterthree to five days. Coughing may continue for severalweeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacter-ial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel-ing of illness persist. To be cured, the bacterial infectionshould be treated with antibiotics.Chronic bronchitisChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratorytract irritants. The most common irritant is cigarettesmoke. The American Lung Association estimates that80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking. Other irritants include chemical fumes, air pollution, and envi-ronmental irritants, such as mold or dust.Chronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. Thecells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair-like outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally, thecilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucusalong the airways. When smoke or other irritants areinhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap off. Whenthis occurs, the cilia are no longer able to move mucus,and the airways become inflamed, narrowed, andclogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and canprogress to the life-threatening disease emphysema.A mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, isusually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.Coughing brings up phlegm, although the amount variesconsiderably from person to person. Wheezing andshortness of breathmay accompany the cough. Diag-nostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As the dis-ease advances, breathing becomes difficult and activitydecreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, lead-ing to changes in the composition of the blood.Diagnosis
Initial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observingthe patient’s symptoms and health history. The physicianwill listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope forspecific sounds that indicate lung inflammation, such asmoist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that indicatesairway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling sound heardwith a stethoscope that is caused by fluid secretion in thebronchial tubes.A sputum culturemay be performed, particularly ifthe sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine whethera bacterial infection is present and to identify the disease-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 598BronchitisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 598causing organism so that an appropriate antibiotic can beselected. Normally, the patient will be asked to coughdeeply, then spit the material that comes up from the lungs(sputum) into a cup. This sample is then grown in the labo-ratory to determine which organisms are present. Theresults are available in two to three days, except for tests fortuberculosis, which can take as long as two months.Occasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder,the sample of sputum is collected using a procedurecalled a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, the patient isgiven a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed into the air-ways to collect a sputum sample.A pulmonary function testis important in diagnos-ing chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.This test uses an instrument called a spirometer to mea-sure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs.The test is done in the doctor’s office and is painless. Itinvolves breathing into the spirometer mouthpiece eithernormally or forcefully. V olumes less than 80% of thenormal values indicate an obstructive lung disease.To better determine what type of obstructive lungdisease a patient has, the doctor may do a chest x ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electrocar-diogram is an instrument that is used to measure the elec-trical activity of the heart and is useful in the diagnosis ofheart conditions. Other tests may be used to measure howeffectively oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged inthe lungs.
Treatment
Acute bronchitisWhen no secondary infection is present, acute bron-chitis is treated in the same way as the common cold. Home care includes drinking plenty of fluids, resting, notsmoking, increasing moisture in the air with a cool misthumidifier, and taking acetaminophen(Datril, Tylenol,Panadol) for fever and pain. Aspirinshould not be givento children because of its association with the serious ill-ness,Reye’s syndrome.Cough suppressantsare used only when the coughis dry and produces no sputum. If the patient is coughingup phlegm, the cough should be allowed to continue. Thepurpose of the cough it to bring up extra mucus and irri-tants from the lungs. When coughing is suppressed, themucus accumulates in the plugged airways and canbecome a breeding ground for pneumonia bacteria.Expectorant cough medicines, unlike cough suppres-sants, do not stop the cough. Instead they are used to thinthe mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. Thistype of cough medicine may be helpful to individuals suf-fering from bronchitis.

Patients need totake the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed. Stoppingthe antibiotic early can lead to a return of the infection.Tetracycline or ampicillin are often used to treat adults.Other possibilities include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxa-zole (Bactrim or Septra) and the newer erythromycin-like drugs, such as azithromycin (Zithromax) and clar-ithromycin (Biaxin). Children under age eight are usual-ly given amoxicillin (Amoxil, Pentamox, Sumox, Tri-mox), because tetracycline discolors permanent teeth thathave not yet come in.Chronic bronchitisThe treatment of chronic bronchitis is complex anddepends on the stage of chronic bronchitis and whetherother health problems are present. Lifestyle changes, suchas quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke orpolluted air, are an important first step. Controlled exer-cise performed on a regular basis is also important.Drug therapy begins with bronchodilators. These drugs relax the muscles of the bronchial tubes and allowincreased air flow. They can be taken by mouth orinhaled using a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a device thatdelivers a regulated flow of medication into the airways.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 599BronchitisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 599Common bronchodilators include albuterol (Ventolin,Proventil, Apo-Salvent) and metaproterenol (Alupent,Orciprenaline, Metaprel, Dey-Dose).Anti-inflammatory medications are added to reduceswelling of the airway tissue. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be taken orally or intravenously. Othersteroids are inhaled. Long-term steroid use can have seri-ous side effects. Other drugs, such as ipratropium (Atro-vent), are given to reduce the quantity of mucus produced.As the disease progresses, the patient may need sup-plemental oxygen. Complications of COPD are manyand often require hospitalization in the latter stages of thedisease.
Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners focus on prevention by eat-ing a healthy diet that strengthens the immune system andpracticing stressmanagement. Bronchitis can becomeserious if it progresses to pneumonia, therefore, antibi-otics may be required. In addition, however, there are amultitude of botanical and herbal medicines that can beformulated to treat bronchitis. Some examples includeinhaling eucalyptus or other essential oils in warm steam.Herbalists recommend a tea made of mullein (Verbascumthapsus), coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), and anise seed(Pimpinella anisum). Homeopathic medicine and tradi- tional Chinese medicinemay also be very useful forbronchitis, and hydrotherapycan contribute to cleaningthe chest and stimulating immune response.
Prognosis
When treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves inone to two weeks without complications, although acough may continue for several more weeks. The pro-gression of chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, may beslowed, and an initial improvement in symptoms may beachieved. Unfortunately, however, there is no cure forchronic bronchitis, and the disease can often lead to orcoexist with emphysema. Taken together, all forms ofCOPD are a leading cause of death.
Prevention
The best way to prevent bronchitis is not to beginsmoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are ten times morelikely to die of COPD than non-smokers. Smokers whostop show improvement in lung function. Other preventa-tive steps include avoiding chemical and environmentalirritants, such as air pollution, and maintaining goodoverall health. Immunizations against certain types ofpneumonia (as well as influenza) are an important pre-ventative measure for anyone with lung or immune sys-tem diseases.ResourcesBOOKS

Bronchodilators
Definition
Bronchodilators are medicines that help open thebronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs, allowing more airto flow through them.
Purpose
People with asthmahave trouble breathing, becausetheir airways are inflamed and become narrowed. Nor-mally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and nosethrough the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungsas a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happensautomatically when the person stops breathing in. In aperson with asthma, breathing in (inhaling) is not a prob-lem. Incoming air can slide around the blockage, becausethe act of breathing in makes the airways expand. Theproblem comes when the person with asthma tries tobreathe out. The air can no longer get past the blockage,and it remains trapped in the lungs. The person can thenonly take shallow breaths. Bronchodilators work byrelaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways. Thismakes the airways open wider and allows air to leave thelungs. These drugs also are used to relieve breathingproblems associated with emphysema, chronic bronchi- tis, and other lung diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 600BronchodilatorsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 600Description
Some bronchodilators are inhaled, using a nebulizeror an inhalation aerosol. Others are taken as injections orby mouth. Most are available only by prescription, but afew, such as ephedrine, can be bought without a physi-cian’s prescription. Examples of bronchodilators arealbuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), epinephrine (Primatene),ipratropium (Atrovent), metaproterenol (Alupent,Metaprel), and terbutaline (Brethine).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type ofbronchodilator and may be different for differentpatients. Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage.
Precautions
Bronchodilators come with patient instructions. Besure to carefully read them before using the medicine. Ifthere is any confusion about how to use the medicine,check with the physician or pharmacist. Always use thesemedicines exactly as directed. Taking larger than recom-mended doses or using the medicine too often can lead toserious side effects and even death.If symptoms do not improve or if they get worseafter using a bronchodilator, call a physician right away.Although some bronchodilators are available with-out a physician’s prescription, these medicines shouldnot be used unless a physician has diagnosed thepatient’s condition as asthma.Some asthma experts believe that the overuse ofbronchodilators can cause asthma to get worse. Theyadvise patients and their physicians to consider control-ling asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs includinginhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate(Beclovent, Vanceril), flunisolide (AeroBid) or triamci-nolone acetonide (Azmacort) Ideally, asthma should becontrolled with an inhaled steroid that is used along withthe bronchodilator. The more the inhaled steroid steroidcontrols the inflammation that causes the asthma, the lessbronchodilator the patient needs to use because symp-toms are under control.Persons with diabetes should be aware that the bron-chodilator epinephrine may raise their blood sugar levels.Patients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator andan aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroidsuch as beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent,Vanceril) should use the bronchodilator first, then wait 5minutes before using the other medicine. Check with aphysician before using any other inhaled medications orother asthma medicines. The physician must determinethe proper amount of time between doses.Some bronchodilator products contain sulfites, thattrigger an allergic reaction in certain people. Anyonewho has a sulfite allergy should read the label carefullyor check with a physician or pharmacist before using abronchodilator. Call a physician immediately if any ofthese signs of an allergic reaction to sulfite occur:• bluish coloration of the skin• flushed or red face or skin• faintness• severe dizziness• increased wheezingor other breathing problems• skin rash,hives, or itching• swelling of the face, lips, or eyelidsSpecial conditionsPeople with certain medical conditions or who aretaking certain other medicines can have problems if theyuse bronchodilators. Before using these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactionsto any bronchodilator or an inhaled form of any otherdrug in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,or other substances.Patients who are allergic to soybeans, soy lecithin,peanuts, or drugs based on atropine should not use thebronchodilator ipratropium (Atrovent).
PREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, somebronchodilators cause birth defectsor miscarriagewhen the animals are given doses many times the usualhuman dose. Whether these drugs cause such problemsin humans in unknown. Any woman who is pregnant orplans to become pregnant should check with her physi-cian before using a bronchodilator.
BREASTFEEDING. Some bronchodilators pass intobreast milk. Breastfeeding mothers should check withtheir physicians before using bronchodilators.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using bron-chodilators, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:• glaucoma• brain damage
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 601BronchodilatorsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 601• convulsions (seizures)—recently or anytime in the past• mental illness• parkinson’s disease• diabetes• heart or blood vessel diseases• rapid or irregular heartbeat• high blood pressure• overactive thyroid• enlarged prostate• obstruction of the neck of the bladder
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using bronchodilatorswith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
Some patients have a dry or irritated throat or a dry mouthafter using bronchodilators. To help prevent theseproblems, gargle and rinse the mouth or take a sip ofwater after each dose.The most common side effects are nervousness orrestlessness and trembling. These problems usually goaway as the body adjusts to the drug and do not requiremedical treatment. Less common side effects, such asbad taste in the mouth, coughing, dizziness or lighthead-KEY TERMS

Bronchoscopy
Definition
Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a cylindricalfiberoptic scope is inserted into the airways. This scopecontains a viewing device that allows the visual examina-tion of the lower airways.
Purpose
During a bronchoscopy, a physician can visuallyexamine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea,bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used to exam-ine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalitiesthat might be associated with a variety of lung diseases.Its use includes the visualization of airway obstructionssuch as a tumor, or the collection of specimens for thediagnosis of canceroriginating in the bronchi of thelungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can also be used to collectspecimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases suchas tuberculosis. The type of specimens collected caninclude sputum (composed of saliva and discharges fromthe respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchior bronchioles, or cells collected from washing the liningof the bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used inbronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindricalinstrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There aretwo types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is some-times referred to as an open-tube or ventilating broncho-scope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube. This tube con-tains four smaller passages—two for light to passthrough, one for seeing through and one that can accom-modate medical instruments that may be used for biopsyor suctioning, or that medication can be passed through.Bronchoscopy may be used for the following pur-poses:• to diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, lung infection, orother lung disease• to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs• to remove a foreign body in the lungs, such as a mucusplug, tumor, or excessive secretions• to remove tissue samples, also known as biopsy, to testfor cancer cells, help with staging the advancement ofthe lung cancer, or to treat a tumor with laser therapy• to allow examination of a suspected tumor, obstruction,secretion, bleeding, or foreign body in the airways• to determine the cause of a persistent cough,wheezing, or a cough that includes blood in the sputum• to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments
Precautions
Patients not breathing adequately on their own dueto severe respiratory failuremay require mechanicalventilation prior to bronchoscopy. It may not be appro-priate to perform bronchoscopy on patients with anunstable heart condition. All patients must be constantlymonitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that anyabnormal reactions can be dealt with immediately.

However, if the purpose of theprocedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the wind-pipe or lungs of a child, the more rigid tube must be usedbecause of its larger size. The patient will either lie face-upon his/her back or sit upright in a chair. Medication todecrease secretions, lessen anxiety, and relax the patientare often given prior to the procedure. While breathingthrough the nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth ornose to numb it. It will take one to two minutes for theanesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the broncho-scope will be put into the patient’s mouth or nose andmoved down into the throat. While the bronchoscope ismoving down the throat, additional anesthesia is put intothe bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airways.Using the eyepiece, the physician then observes the tra-chea and bronchi, and the mucosal lining of these passage-ways, looking for any abnormalities that may be present.If the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissuesamples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial brush are usedto obtain cells. If the purpose is to identify an infectiousagent, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used togather fluid for culture purposes. Also, if any foreignmatter is found in the airways, it can be removed.Another procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu-orescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect pre-cancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo-rescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissuewill appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appeargreen. This technique can help detect lung cancer at anearly stage, so that treatment can be started early.Alternative proceduresDepending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,alternatives might include a computed tomography scan(CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per-formed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on achest x rayor CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsyspecimens, one option is to perform surgery, which carriesgreater risks. Another option is percutaneous (through theskin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.Preparation
The doctor should be informed of any allergiesand all the medications that the patient is currently taking. Thedoctor may instruct the patient not to take medicationslike aspirinor anti-inflammatory drugs, which interferewith clotting, for a period of time prior to the procedure.The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro-cedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day ofthe procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60minutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior tothe bronchoscopy, several tests may be done, including achest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy isdone under general anesthesia. Patients usually have anintravenous (IV) line in the arm. Most likely, the proce-dure will be done under local anesthesia, which is sprayedinto the nose or mouth. This is necessary to decrease thegag reflex. A sedative may also be used to help the patientrelax. It is important that the patient understands that at notime will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can besupplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consentform is necessary for this procedure.
Aftercare
After the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitoredfor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, andbreathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes patients havean abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All saliva should bespit into a basin so that it can be examined for the pres-ence of blood. If a biopsy was taken, the patient shouldnot cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge anyblood clot that has formed and cause bleeding. No food ordrink should be consumed for about two hours after theprocedure or until the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradu-ally progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to thepatient’s regular diet. There will also be a temporary sore throatand hoarseness that may last for a few days.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 604BronchoscopyBronchoscope
Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a hollow, flexibletube is inserted into the airways, allowing the physician tovisually examine the lower airways, including the larynx, tra-chea, bronchi, and bronchioles. It can also be used to col-lect specimens for bacteriological culture to diagnose infec-tious diseases such as tuberculosis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 604Risks
Minor side effects arise from the bronchoscope caus-ing abrasion of the lining of the airways. This results insome swelling and inflammation, as well as hoarsenesscaused from abrading the vocal cords. If this abrasion ismore serious, it can lead to respiratory difficulty or bleed-ing of the airway lining. A more serious risk involved inhaving a bronchoscopy performed is the occurrence of apneumothorax, due to puncturing of the lungs, whichallows air to escape into the space between the lung andthe chest wall. These risks are greater with the use of arigid bronchoscope than with a fiberoptic bronchoscope.If a rigid tube is used, there is also a risk of chipped teeth.
Normal results
Normal tracheal appearance consists of smoothmuscle with C-shaped rings of cartilage at regular inter-vals. The trachea and the bronchi are lined with a mucousmembrane.
Abnormal results
Abnormal bronchoscopy findings may involveabnormalities of the bronchial wall such as inflamma-tion, swelling, ulceration, or anatomical abnormalities.The bronchoscopy may also reveal the presence ofabnormal substances in the trachea and bronchi. If sam-ples are taken, the results could indicate cancer, disease-causing agents or other lung disease. Other abnormalitiesinclude constriction or narrowing (stenosis), compres-sion, dilation of vessels, or abnormal branching of thebronchi. Abnormal substances that might be found in theairways include blood, secretions, or mucous plugs. Anyabnormalities are discussed with the patient.KEY TERMS
Anesthesia—A drug used to loss of sensation. It isused to lessen the pain of surgery and medicalprocedures.Bronchi—The network of tubular passages thatcarry air to the lungs and allow air to be expelledfrom the lungs.Bronchioles—Small airways extending from thebronchi into the lobes of the lungs.Bronchoalveolar lavage—Washing cells from theair sacs at the end of the bronchioles.Trachea—The windpipe.ResourcesBOOKS

Brucellosis
Definition
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by membersof the Brucellagenus that can infect humans but primari-ly infects livestock. Symptoms of the disease includeintermittent fever, sweating, chills, aches, and mentaldepression. The disease can become chronic and recur,particularly if untreated.
Description
Also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, Gibraltarfever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean fever, brucellosisis most likely to occur among those individuals who reg-ularly work with livestock. The disease originated indomestic livestock but was passed on to wild animalspecies, including the elk and buffalo of the westernUnited States. In humans, brucellosis continues to bespread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infectedcows or through contact with the discharges of cattle andgoats during miscarriage. In areas of the world wheremilk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin Americaand the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted byingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in theUnited States, the widespread pasteurization of milk andnearly complete eradication of the infection from cattlehas reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in1940 to about 70 in 1994.
Causes and symptoms
The disease is caused by several different species ofparasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella. B. abortusis found in cattle and can cause cows to abort their fetuses.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 605BrucellosisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 605B. suisis most often found in hogs and is more deadlywhen contracted by humans than the organism found incattle. B. melitensisis found in goats and sheep and caus-es the most severe illness in humans. B. rangiferiinfects reindeer and caribou, and B. canisis found in dogs.A human contracts the disease by coming into con-tact with an infected animal and either allowing the bac-teria to enter a cut, breathing in the bacteria, or by con-suming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese obtainedfrom a contaminated animal. In the United States, thedisease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers.Scientists do not agree about whether brucellosiscan be transmitted from one person to another, althoughsome people have been infected from a tainted bloodtransfusionor bone marrow transplant. Newborn babieshave also contracted the illness from their mothers dur-ing birth. Currently, it is believed that brucellosis canalso be transmitted sexually.The disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittentfevers (a source of its nickname, “undulant fever”) can beexhausting. Symptoms usually appear between five daysand a month after exposure and begin with a single boutof high fever accompanied by shivering, aching, anddrenching sweats that last for a few days. Other symp-toms may include headache, poor appetite, backache,weakness, and depression. Mental depression can be sosevere that the patient may become suicidal.In rare, untreated cases, the disease can become sosevere that it leads to fatal complications, such as pneu- moniaor bacterial meningitis. B. melitensiscan cause miscarriages, especially during the first three months ofpregnancy. The condition can also occur in a chronicform, in which symptoms recur over a period of monthsor years.KEY TERMS
Antibody—A specific protein produced by theimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.Chronic—Disease or condition characterized byslow onset over a long period of time.Parasite—An organism living in or on, and obtain-ing nourishment from, another organism.Pasteurization—The process of applying heat,usually to milk or cheese, for the purpose ofkilling, or retarding the development of, pathogen-ic bacteria.Diagnosis
Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one ormore Brucellaspecies in blood or urine samples. Thebacteria may be positively identified using biochemicalmethods or using a technique whereby, if present in thesample, the brucellosis bacteria are made to fluoresce.Brucellosis may also be diagnosed by culturing and iso-lating the bacteria from one of the above samples. Bloodsamples will also indicate elevated antibody levels orincreased amounts of a protein produced directly inresponse to infection with brucellosis bacteria.
Treatment
Prolonged treatment with antibiotics, includingtetracyclines(with streptomycin), co-trimoxazole, andsulfonamides, is effective. Bed rest is also imperative. Inthe chronic form of brucellosis, the symptoms may recur,requiring a second course of treatment.
Prognosis
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential toprevent chronic infection. Untreated, the disease may lingerfor years, but it is rarely fatal. Relapses may also occur.
Prevention
There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, buthumans can be protected by controlling the disease inlivestock. After checking to make sure an animal is notalready infected, and destroying those that are, all live-stock should be immunized. Butchers and those whowork in slaughterhouses should wear protective glassesand clothing, and protect broken skin from infection.Some experts suggest that a person with the diseaserefrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of thedisease. The sexual partners of an infected person shouldalso be closely monitored for signs of infection.Resources

Bruises
Definition
Bruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and ten-derness of the skin or mucous membranes due to theleakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into thetissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a diseasecondition. A very small bruise is called a petechia. Theseoften appear as many tiny red dots clustered together,and could indicate a serious problem.
Description
Bruises change colors over time in a predictable pat-tern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injuryoccurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise willbe reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. Afterone to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down,and the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color.This fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth orninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have abrown or yellowish appearance, and it will graduallydiminish back to its normal color.Long periods of standing will cause the blood thatcollects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruisesare actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood inone place may flow downhill after awhile and appear inanother. For instance, bruising in the back of theabdomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising inthe thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle.
Causes and symptoms
Healthy people may develop bruises from any injurythat doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercise may also cause bruises due to bringing about small tearsin blood vessels walls. In a condition known as purpurasimplex, there is a tendency to bruise easily due to anincreased fragility of the blood vessels. Bruises alsodevelop easily in the elderly, because the skin and bloodvessels have a tendency to become thinner and morefragile with aging, and there is an increased use of med-ications that interfere with the blood clotting system. Inthe condition known as purpura senilis, the elderly devel-op bruises from minimal contact that may take up to sev-eral months to completely heal.The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such asibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead toincreased bruising. Aspirin, antidepressants,asthma medications, and cortisone medications also have thiseffect. The anti-clotting medications also known as bloodthinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin), maybe the cause of particularly severe bruising.Sometimes bruises are connected with more seriousillnesses. There are a number of diseases that causeexcessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight tohave consequences in healthy people. An abnormal ten-dency to bleed may be due to hereditary bleeding disor-ders, certain prescription medications, diseases of the

If there are large areas of bruis-ing or bruises develop very easily, this may herald aproblem. Other causes that should be ruled out includeliver disease,alcoholism, drug addiction, and acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Bruising thatoccurs around the navel may indicate dangerous internalbleeding; bruising behind the ear, called Battle’s sign,may be due to a skull fracture; and raised bruises maypoint to autoimmune disease.
Diagnosis
Bruising is usually a minor problem, which does notrequire a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten-sive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis-ing in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu-ation that will include a number of blood tests. If the areaof the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required.
Treatment
A bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It isoften recommended that ice packs be applied on and offduring the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.After that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommendedto increase the circulation and the healing of the injuredtissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres-sion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation ofblood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannotcompletely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, itmay have to be surgically removed.
Alternative treatment
Several types of topical applications are usually rec-ommend to speed healing and to reduce the painassoci- ated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied direct-ly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witchhazel,Hamamelis virginiana, can be used. This willtighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising.The homeopathic remedy,Arnica montana, can be applied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.Oral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,pain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana, at 30 ml (1oz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom-mended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times perday is also useful.
Prognosis
The blood under the skin which causes the discol-oration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by thebody in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin colorshould completely return to normal.Sometimes, a bruise may become solid and increasein size instead of dissolving. This may indicate bloodtrapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained.This is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, thebody may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in aprocess called heterotopic ossification.Prevention
Vitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood,and therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruiseeasily. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, broccoli, seaweed,and fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K. Othergood foods to eat would be those containingbioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These canassist in strengthening the connective tissue, which willdecrease the spread of blood and bruising. Zinc and vita-min C supplements are also recommended for this.Resources

Bruxism
Definition
Bruxism is the habit of clenching and grinding theteeth. It most often occurs at night during sleep, but itmay also occur during the day. It is an unconsciousbehavior, perhaps performed to release anxiety, aggres- sion, or anger.
Description
Bruxism is one of the oldest disorders known, andapproximately one in four adults experiences it. Most peo-ple are not aware of it before their teeth have been damaged.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 608BruxismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 608Causes and symptoms
While bruxism is typically associated with stress,i t may also be triggered by abnormal occlusion (the waythe upper and lower teeth fit together), or crooked ormissing teeth.Symptoms of bruxism include: dull headaches; soreand tired facial muscles; earaches; sensitive teeth; andlocking, popping, and clicking of the jaw.During a dental examination, a dentist may recognizedamage resulting from bruxism, including: enamel lossfrom the chewing surfaces of teeth; flattened tooth surfaces;loosened teeth; and fractured teeth and fillings. Left untreat-ed, bruxism may lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction.
Diagnosis
Medical and dental histories and examinations arenecessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditionsthat may cause similar pain, such as ear infections, dentalinfections, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunc-tion. However, uncommonly worn-down teeth stronglysuggest a diagnosis of bruxism.
Treatment
To prevent further damage to the teeth, bruxism istreated by placing a removable, custom-fitted plasticappliance called a night guard between the upper andlower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding behav-ior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic insteadof each other.In some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjustedand high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in amore comfortable position. Missing teeth may bereplaced and crooked teeth may be straightened withorthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlyingcauses of bruxism. In cases where jaw muscles are verytight, a dentist may prescribe muscle relaxants.
Alternative treatment
Stress management and behavior modification tech-niques may be useful to break the habit of clenching andteeth grinding. Tight jaw muscles may be relaxed byapplying warm compresses to the sides of the face.Herbal muscle relaxants also can be helpful. Massage therapyand deep tissue realignment, including rolfing, can assist in releasing the clenching pattern. This is amore permanent alternative treatment for bruxism.
Prognosis
Bruxism may cause permanent damage to teeth andchronic jaw pain unless properly diagnosed and promptlyKEY TERMS
Enamel—The hard outermost surface of a tooth.High spot—An area of a tooth or restoration thatfeels abnormal or uncomfortable because it hits itsopposing tooth before other teeth meet.Night guard—A removable, custom-fitted plasticappliance that fits between the upper and lowerteeth to prevent them from grinding against eachother.Occlusion—The way upper and lower teeth fittogether during biting and chewing.Rolfing—Based on the belief that proper align-ment of various parts of the body is necessary forphysical and mental health, rolfing uses deep tis-sue massage and movement exercises in anattempt to bring the body into correct alignment.Temporomandibular joint (TMJ)—The jaw jointformed by the mandible (lower jaw bone) movingagainst the temporal bone of the skull.treated. The behavior may be eliminated if its underlyingcauses are found and addressed.
Prevention
Increased awareness in patients prone to anxiety,aggression, or anger may prevent the habit of bruxismfrom developing.Resources

Budd-Chiari syndrome
Definition
Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare problem that resultsfrom blood clotting in the veins flowing out of the liver
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 609Budd-Chiari syndromeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 609(hepatic veins). The high pressure of blood in these veinsleads to an enlarged liver, and to an accumulation of fluidin the abdomen, called ascites.
Description
The liver, the largest internal organ in the humanbody, is responsible for many vital physiologic process-es. Blood flow through the liver nourishes the liver, car-ries in substances that the liver will process, and carriesaway substances that the liver has produced. When bloodcannot flow out freely from the liver, blood pressure risesin the veins of the liver, leading to blood clots within theliver. Also, some of the blood plasma can leak throughthe walls of the veins and accumulate within theabdomen (ascites).
Causes and symptoms
The major symptoms include painin the upperright-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of fluidin the abdomen. In the United States, blood disorders arethe most common causes. Among these disorders arepolycythemia rubra vera (an increase in the number ofred blood cells), and sickle cell disease. In parts of theworld where liver canceris common, a form of livercanceris the most frequent cause.Other causes sometimes include:• certain infections• use of oral contraceptives• body changes in pregnancyand the postpartum period• phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)• injury to the abdomen• membranous webs (especially in Asia)KEY TERMS
Ascites—Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.Biopsy—Surgical removal of a tiny bit of tissue forexamination under the microscope.Catheter—A tubular surgical instrument.Phlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.Polycythemia rubra vera—An excess number ofred blood cells in the blood.Sickle cell disease—An inherited disease in whichred blood cells take an unusual shape, leading tocirculation problems.Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made byan internist (a specialist in diseases of the internalorgans), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseasesof the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On physi- cal examination, the doctor will note that the liver islarger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the liverwill show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an abnor-mal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other abnormali-ties. A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities.Once these abnormalities are confirmed, the key testis called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a narrowtube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepat-ic veins. An instrument at the tip of the catheter can mea-sure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein.In some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material isinjected into a patient, and then an abnormal pattern ofradioactivity in the liver can be revealed. In other cases, aliver biopsyenables a physician to examine cells from theliver itself. Cells damaged by Budd-Chiari syndrome have acharacteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician.
Treatment
SurgeryMost patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome musthave surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow aroundthe clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the venacava. The exact technique will depend on the specificlocation of the clots and other factors. In certain patients,other surgical techniques may be used. For patients whootherwise would have less than six months to live, liver transplantationis sometimes performed.In a few patients, a “balloon catheter” can open theblocked blood vessels, without the need for major surgery.DrugsSometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinasecan be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting inthe veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to workwhen the clots have become established.
Prognosis
If surgery is done before permanent liver damage setsin, long-term survival is possible. In these cases, damagedliver cells can actually recover. If patients are already verysick with liver disease, the surgery may not be as helpful.
Prevention
The best approach to prevention is to carefully controlthe blood disorders that can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Buerger’s disease
Definition
Buerger’s disease is an inflammation of the arteries,veins, and nerves in the legs, principally, leading torestricted blood flow. Left untreated, Buerger’s diseasecan lead to gangreneof the affected areas. Buerger’s dis-ease is also known as thromboangitis obliterans.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of Buerger’s disease is not known. Itis seen most often in young to middle-aged men (ages20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes. Cases ofthis disease in non-smokers are very rare, hence, ciga-rette smokingis considered a causative factor. Approxi-mately 40% of the patients have a history of inflamma-tion of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a role in thedevelopment of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainlyseen in the legs of affected persons, but may also appearin their arms. Early symptoms include decrease in theblood supply (arterial ischemia) and superficial (near theskin surface) phlebitis. The main symptom is painin the affected areas. Onset of the disease is gradual and firstoccurs in the feet or hands. Inflammation occurs in smalland medium-sized arteries and veins near the surface ofthe limb. In advanced cases, blood vessels in other partsof the body may be affected. There is a progressivedecrease in the blood flow to the affected areas. Thepulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. Thelack of blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decayof tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivityin the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease, can develop. In this case, the hands turn color—white,blue, and then red—when exposed to the cold.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually made from the clinical symp-toms. Patients frequently complain of numbness, tin-gling, or burning sensations in the affected area beforeevidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparent.KEY TERMS
Gangrene—A decay of the tissue in a part of thebody that experiences restricted blood flow.Inflammation—A local reaction to irritation, injury,or infection characterized by pain, swelling, red-ness, and occasional loss of function.Ischemia—A decrease in the blood supply to anarea of the body caused by obstruction or con-striction of blood vessels.Phlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.
Treatment
There is no effective medication or surgery for thisdisease. Patients must stop smoking to halt further devel-opment of the symptoms. Vasodilators, drugs thatincrease the diameter of the blood vessels, can be admin-istered, but may not be effective. Exposure of affectedareas to heat or cold should be avoided. Trauma to thefeet and other affected areas should be avoided and infec-tions must be treated promptly.
Prognosis
The disease is progressive in patients who do notstop smoking. Areas with gangrene must be removed sur-gically.
Prevention
Smoking is the only known causative agent for thisdisease and should be avoided.Resources

Bulimia nervosa
Definition
Bulimia nervosa is a serious and sometimes life-threatening eating disorder affecting mainly young
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 611Bulimia nervosaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 611women. People with bulimia, known as bulimics, consumelarge amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid them-selves of the food and calories (purge) by fasting, exces- sive exercise, vomiting, or using laxatives. The behavioroften serves to reduce stressand relieve anxiety. Because bulimia results from an excessive concern with weightcontrol and self-image, and is often accompanied bydepression, it is also considered a psychiatric illness.
Description
Bulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for overtwo million adolescent girls and young women in theUnited States. The bingeing and purging activity associ-ated with this disorder can cause severe damage, evendeath, although the risk of death is not as high as foranorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that leads to exces-sive weight loss.Binge eating may in rare instances cause the stom-ach to rupture. In the case of purging,heart failurecan result due to loss of vital mineralssuch as potassium.V omiting causes other serious problems, including acid-related scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit-ing) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tubethat brings food from the mouth to the stomach (theesophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glandscan become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can alsoresult, and interest in sex may diminish.Most bulimics find it difficult to stop their behaviorwithout professional help. Many typically recognize thatthe behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Somebulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviorssuch as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer fromother psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression,anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD).Most bulimics are females in their teens or early 20s.Males account for only 5-10% of all cases. People of allraces develop the disorder, but most of those diagnosedare white.Bulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy,accompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly,many people with bulimia appear healthy and successful,while inside they have feelings of helplessness and lowself-esteem.
Causes and symptoms
CausesThe cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchersbelieve that it may be caused by a combination of geneticand environmental factors. Bulimia tends to run in fami-lies. Research shows that certain brain chemicals, knownas neurotransmitters, may function abnormally in acutelyill bulimia patients. Scientists also believe there may be alink between bulimia and other psychiatric problems,such as depression and OCD. Environmental influencesinclude participation in work or sports that emphasizethinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam-ily pressures also may play a role. One study found thatmothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh-ters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to causebulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend tohave fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.SymptomsAccording to the American Anorexia/Bulimia Asso-ciation, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:• eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)• vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, or engaging infasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)• preoccupation with body weight• using the bathroom frequently after meals• depression or mood swings• irregular menstrual periods• onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,heartburnor bloatingDiagnosis
Bulimia is treated most successfully when diag-nosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is aproblem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com-plete physical examinationin order to rule out other ill-nesses is the first step to diagnosis.According to the American Psychiatric Association,a diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all ofthe following symptoms:• recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum averageof two binge-eating episodes a week for at least threemonths)• a feeling of lack of control over eating during thebinges• regular use of one or more of the following to preventweight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives ordiuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise• persistent over-concern with body shape and weight
Treatment
Early treatment is important otherwise bulimia maybecome chronic, with serious health consequences. Acomprehensive treatment plan is called for in order toaddress the complex interaction of physical and psycho-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 612Bulimia nervosaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 612logical problems in bulimia. A combination of drug andbehavioral therapies is commonly used.Behavioral approaches include individual psychother-apy,group therapy, and family therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches patients how to changeabnormal thoughts and behavior, is also used. Nutrition counseling and self-help groups are often helpful.Antidepressants commonly used to treat bulimiainclude desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil),and fluoxetine (Prozac). These medications also maytreat any co-existing depression.In addition to professional treatment, family supportplays an important role in helping the bulimic person.Encouragement and caring can provide the support neededto convince the sick person to get help, stay with treatment,or try again after a failure. Family members can help locateresources, such as eating disorder clinics in local hospitalsor treatment programs in colleges designed for students.
Alternative treatment
Light therapy—exposure to bright, artificial light—may be useful in reducing bulimic episodes, especiallyduring the dark winter months. Some feel that massagemay prove helpful, putting people in touch with the reali-ty of their own bodies and correcting misconceptions ofbody image. Hypnotherapymay help resolve uncon-scious issues that contribute to bulimic behavior.
Prognosis
Bulimia may become chronic and lead to serioushealth problems, including seizures, irregular heartbeat,and thin bones. In rare cases, it may be fatal.Timely therapy and medication can effectively man-age the disorder and help the bulimic look forward to anormal, productive, and fulfilling life.
Prevention
There is no known method to prevent bulimia.Resources

Bundle branch block
Definition
Bundle branch block (BBB) is a disruption in thenormal flow of electrical pulses that drive the heart beat.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 613Bundle branch blockGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 613Description
Bundle branch block belongs to a group of heart prob-lems called intraventricular conduction defects (IVCD).There are two bundle branches, right and left. The rightbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theright ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart) and the leftbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theleft ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at ajunction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses comethrough the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of Hisand then move into the right and left bundle branches.Bundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerveimpulses. A problem may exist in any of the three bundles.Patients with BBB are generally without symptomsunless the disease is severe enough to cause a completeinfranodal A-V block and very slow heart rate. In patientswith right bundle branch block (RBBB), the nerve impulseis conducted slowly or not at all. The right ventricle finallyreceives the impulse through muscle-to-muscle spread,outside the regular nerve pathway. This mechanism ofimpulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed con-traction of the right ventricle. There are several types ofleft bundle branch block (LBBB), each producing its owncharacteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, thenerve impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBBmay have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy.
Causes and symptoms
Left bundle branch block usually happens as a con-sequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis,rheumatic fever,congenital heart disease,myocardi-tis, myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, orother invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branchblock happens less often from underlying heart disease.
Diagnosis
Detection of BBB usually takes place during a nor-mal physical examination. The block shows up as aKEY TERMS

The pat-tern seen in the electrocardiogram indicates pulses in aheart beat and their duration. A QRS duration of greaterthan 110 milliseconds is a diagnostic indication of BBB.There is a unique ECG pattern for blocks in each of thethree bundles.
Treatment
There is no specific therapy for BBB. Patients areusually treated for associated heart diseases.
Prognosis
The prognosis of blockage in any of the three bundlebranches depends on the prognosis of the associated heartdisease. The associated diseases determine the outcomeof the patient’s health. Occasionally, disruptions in bundlebranches lead to complete infranodal A-V block, a moreserious blockage of nerve impulses. Approximately 2% ofpatients with BBB develop infranodal A-V blockage andthese patients often require artificial pacemakers.Resources

Bunion
Definition
A bunion is an abnormal enlargement of the joint(the first metatarsophalangeal joint, or MTPJ) at the baseof the great or big toe (hallux). It is caused by inflamma-tion and usually results from chronic irritation and pres-sure from poorly fitting footwear.
Description
A displacement of two major bones of the foot (hal-lux valgus) causes bunions, although not everyone withthis displacement will develop the joint swelling andbone overgrowth that characterize a bunion. One of thebones involved is called the first metatarsal bone. Thisbone is long and slender, with the big toe attached on one
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 614BunionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 614end and the other end connected to foot bones closer tothe ankle. This foot bone is displaced in the direction ofthe four other metatarsals connected with the toes. Theother bone involved is the big toe itself, which is dis-placed toward the smaller toes. As the big toe continuesto move toward the smaller toes, it may become dis-placed under or over the second toe. The displacement ofthese two foot bones causes a projection of bone on theinside portion of the forefoot. The skin over this projec-tion often becomes inflamed from rubbing against theshoe, and a callus may form.The joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled withfluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to movesmoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac becomesinflamed and thickened. The swelling in the joint causesadditional painand pressure in the toe.
Causes and symptoms
Bunions may form as a result of abnormal motion ofthe foot during walking or running. One common exam-ple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount ofstressplaced upon the inside of the foot. This leads tofriction and irritation of the involved structures. Age hasalso been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in partbecause the underlying bone displacement worsens overtime unless corrective measures are taken.Wearing improperly fitting shoes, especially thosewith a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, oftencauses the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformityis seen more often in women than men. The higher fre-quency in females may be related to the strong linkbetween footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in arecent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% woreshoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow.Because genetic factors can predispose people to thehallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family historyof bunions can increase the likelihood of developing thisfoot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and severalgenetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn-dromeand Marfan syndrome, cause muscle imbal-ances that can create bunions from displacement of thefirst metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes ofbunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunionpresent on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to thejoint of the big toe.Symptoms of bunions include the common signs ofinflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. Thediscomfort is primarily located along the inside of thefoot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callusmay develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of thetoes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs.Inflammation of this area causes a decrease in motionwith associated discomfort in the joint between the bigtoe and the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skinover the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, whichalso presents a problem of potential infection. (Footulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia-betes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer formingand healing if it becomes infected.)
Diagnosis
A thorough medical history and physical exam by aphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis ofbunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con-firm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement,joint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth ofbone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con-sider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by orcomplicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of thecartilage of the joint),gout(which causes the accumula-tion of uric acid crystals in the joint), tiny fracturesof a bone in the foot (stress fractures), or infection and mayorder additional tests to rule out these possibilities.
Treatment
ConservativeThe first step in treating a bunion is to remove asmuch pressure from the area as possible. People withbunions should wear shoes that have enough room in thetoe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid high-heeledshoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings. Dressings andpads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pres-sure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts(orthotics) to correct the alignment of the big toe joint iseffective for many bunions. Most patients are instructed to

In some cases,physicians also use steroid injections with local anestheticaround the bunion to reduce inflammation.SurgeryIf conservative treatment is not successful, surgicalremoval of the bunion may be necessary to correct thedeformity. This procedure is called a bunionectomy, andthere are many variations on the operation, which is usu-ally performed by a surgeon who specializes in treatingbone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who specializesin treating the foot (podiatry). Surgeons consider theangle of the bone misalignment, the condition of thebursa, and the strength of the bones when they choosewhich procedure to use. Most bunionectomies involvethe removal of a section of bone and the insertion of pinsto rejoin the bone. Sometimes the surgeons may moveligaments (which connect bone to bone in the joint) ortendons (which connect bone to muscle) in order torealign the bones. After this procedure, the bones andother tissues are held in place while they heal by com-pression dressings or a short cast. The individual mustrefrain from vigorous exercisefor six weeks.
Alternative treatment
Deep friction massage techniques by a physical ormassage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation,reduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue build up.Physical therapy also provides useful approaches such asultrasound to help retard or reverse the formation of thebunion. Various taping techniques can be useful torealign the toe and decrease friction and rubbing thatmay be present. The homeopathic tissue salt Calcarea phosphoricacan be useful in balancing the bone forma-tion/remodeling.KEY TERMS

Often modifications in footwear allow a good prog-nosis without surgery. If surgery is necessary, completehealing without complications requires approximatelyfour to six weeks. Even after surgery corrects the bonemisalignment, patients are usually instructed to continuewearing low-heeled, roomy shoes to prevent the bunionfrom reforming.
Prevention
Prevention begins with proper foot wear. Shoes with awide and deep toe box are best. High-heeled shoes shouldnot be worn for long periods of time. If a bunion is presentand becomes inflamed, the foot should be elevated with theapplication of an ice pack over the painful area for not morethan 20 minutes every other hour. If pain and swelling con-tinue, a podiatrist or physician should be contacted.Resources

Burns
Definition
Burns are injuries to tissues caused by heat, friction,electricity, radiation, or chemicals.
Description
Burns are characterized by degree, based on theseverity of the tissue damage. A first-degree burn causes
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 616BurnsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 616redness and swelling in the outermost layers of skin (epi-dermis). A second-degree burn involves redness, swellingand blistering, and the damage may extend beneath theepidermis to deeper layers of skin (dermis). A third-degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroys theentire depth of skin, causing significant scarring. Damagealso may extend to the underlying fat, muscle, or bone.The severity of the burn is also judged by theamount of body surface area (BSA) involved. Health careworkers use the “rule of nines” to determine the percent-age of BSA affected in patients more than 9 years old:each arm with its hand is 9% of BSA; each leg with itsfoot is 18%; the front of the torso is 18%; the back of thetorso, including the buttocks, is 18%; the head and neckare 9%; and the genital area (perineum) is 1%. This rulecannot be applied to a young child’s body proportions, soBSA is estimated using the palm of the patient’s hand asa measure of 1% area.The severity of the burn will determine not only thetype of treatment, but also where the burn patient shouldreceive treatment. Minor burns may be treated at home orin a doctor’s office. These are defined as first- or second-degree burns covering less than 15% of an adult’s bodyor less than 10% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burnon less than 2% BSA. Moderate burns should be treatedat a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degreeburns covering 15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-20%of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10%BSA. Critical, or major, burns are the most serious andshould be treated in a specialized burn unit of a hospital.These are defined as first- or second-degree burns cover-ing more than 25% of an adult’s body or more than 20%of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on more than10% BSA. In addition, burns involving the hands, feet,face, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical. Otherfactors influence the level of treatment needed, includingassociated injuries such as bone fracturesand smoke inhalation, presence of a chronic disease, or a history ofbeing abused. Also, children and the elderly are morevulnerable to complications from burn injuries andrequire more intensive care.
Causes and symptoms
Burns may be caused by even a brief encounter withheat greater than 120°F (49°C). The source of this heat maybe the sun (causing a sunburn), hot liquids, steam, fire,electricity, friction (causing rug burns and rope burns), andchemicals (causing a caustic burn upon contact).

There are three classifications of burns: first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree burns. (Illustration by Electronic Illustra- tors Group.)GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 617Signs of a burn are localized redness, swelling, andpain. A severe burn will also blister. The skin may alsopeel, appear white or charred, and feel numb. A burn maytrigger a headacheand fever. Extensive burns mayinduce shock, the symptoms of which are faintness,weakness, rapid pulse and breathing, pale and clammyskin, and bluish lips and fingernails.
Diagnosis
A physician will diagnose a burn based upon visualexamination, and will also ask the patient or family mem-bers questions to determine the best treatment. He or shemay also check for smoke inhalation,carbon monoxidepoisoning, cyanide poisoning, other event-related trau-ma, or, if suspected, further evidence of child abuse.
Treatment
Burn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventinginfection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, andcalorie intake while the body heals. Treatment of chemi-cal or electrical burns is slightly different from the treat-ment of thermal burns but the objectives are the same.Thermal burn treatmentThe first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop theburning process. This may be accomplished by letting coolwater run over the burned area or by soaking it in cool (notcold) water. Ice should never be applied to the burn. Cool(not cold) wet compresses may provide some pain reliefwhen applied to small areas of first- and second-degreeburns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never beapplied to the burn since it prevents heat from escapingand drives the burning process deeper into the skin.If the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently withsoap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the skinof the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to befurther irritated by pressure or friction, the burn shouldbe left exposed to the air to promote healing. If the skinis broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area shouldbe coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment and cov-ered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin,acetaminophen(Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to ease painand relieve inflammation. A doctor should be consultedif these signs of infection appear: increased warmth, red-ness, pain, or swelling; pus or similar drainage from thewound; swollen lymph nodes; or red streaks spreadingaway from the burn.In situations where a person has received moderate orcritical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence overburn treatment and emergency medical assistance must becalled. A person with serious burns may stop breathing,and artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouthresuscitation or rescue breathing) should be administeredimmediately. Also, a person with burns covering morethan 12% BSA is likely to go into shock; this conditionmay be prevented by laying the person flat and elevatingthe feet about 12 in (30 cm). Burned arms and handsshould also be raised higher than the person’s heart.In rescues, a blanket may be used to smother anyflames as the person is removed from danger. The personwhose clothing is on fire should “stop, drop, and roll” orbe assisted in lying flat on the ground and rolling to putout the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comesoff easily should be removed; any clothing embedded inthe burn should not be disturbed. Removing any smol-dering apparel and covering the person with a light, cool,wet cloth, such as a sheet but not a blanket or towel, willstop the burning process.At the hospital, the staff will provide further med-ical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be inserted ifthe patient’s airways or lungs have been damaged, ascan happen during an explosion or a fire in a enclosedspace. Also, because burns dramatically deplete thebody of fluids, replacement fluids are administeredintravenously. The patient is also given antibioticsintra- venously to prevent infection, and he or she may alsoreceive a tetanusshot, depending on his or her immu-nization history. Once the burned area is cleaned andtreated with antibiotic cream or ointment, it is coveredin sterile bandages, which are changed two to threetimes a day. Surgical removal of dead tissue ( debride- ment) also takes place. As the burns heal, thick, tautscabs (eschar) form, which the doctor may have to cut toimprove blood flow to the more elastic healthy tissuebeneath. The patient will also undergo physical and

First-Degree (Minor) The burned area is painful. The outer skin is reddened. Slight swelling is present.Second-Degree (Moderate) The burned area is painful. The underskin is affected. Blisters may form. The area may have a wet, shin y appearance because of exposed tissue. Third-Degree (Critical) The burned area is insensitive due to the destruction of nerve endings. Skin is destroyed.Muscle tissues  and bone underneath may be damaged. The area may be charred, white, or grayish in color.GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 618occupational therapy to keep the burned areas frombecoming inflexible and to minimize scarring.In cases where the skin has been so damaged that itcannot properly heal, a skin graft is usually performed. Askin graft involves taking a piece of skin from anunburned portion of the patient’s body (autograft) andtransplanting it to the burned area. When doctors cannotimmediately use the patient’s own skin, a temporary graftis performed using the skin of a human donor (allograft),either alive or dead, or the skin of an animal (xenograft),usually that of a pig.The burn victim also may be placed in a hyperbaricchamber, if one is available. In a hyperbaric chamber(which can be a specialized room or enclosed space), thepatient is exposed to pure oxygen under high pressure,which can aid in healing. However, for this therapy to beeffective, the patient must be placed in a chamber within24 hours of being burned.Chemical burn treatmentBurns from liquid chemicals must be rinsed withcool water for at least 15 minutes to stop the burningprocess. Any burn to the eye must be similarly flushedwith water. In cases of burns from dry chemicals such aslime, the powder should be completely brushed awaybefore the area is washed. Any clothing which may haveabsorbed the chemical should be removed. The burnshould then be loosely covered with a sterile gauze padand the person taken to the hospital for further treatment.A physician may be able to neutralize the offendingchemical with another before treating the burn like athermal burn of similar severity.Electrical burn treatmentBefore electrical burns are treated at the site of theaccident, the power source must be disconnected if possi-ble and the victim moved away from it to keep the persongiving aid from being electrocuted. Lifesaving measuresagain take priority over burn treatment, so breathingmust be checked and assisted if necessary. Electricalburns should be loosely covered with sterile gauze padsand the person taken to the hospital for further treatment.
Alternative treatment
In addition to the excellent treatment of burns pro-vided by traditional medicine, some alternativeapproaches may be helpful as well. (Major burns shouldalways be treated by a medical practitioner.) The homeo-pathic remedies Cantharisand Causticumcan assist inburn healing. A number of botanical remedies, appliedtopically, can also help burns heal. These include aloeKEY TERMS
Debridement—The surgical removal of dead tis-sue.Dermis—The basal layer of skin; it contains bloodand lymphatic vessels, nerves, glands, and hairfollicles.Epidermis—The outer portion of skin, made up offour or five superficial layers.Shock—An abnormal condition resulting from lowblood volume due to hemorrhage or dehydration.Signs of shock include rapid pulse and breathing,and cool, moist, pale skin.(Aloe barbadensis), oil of St.-John’s-wort (Hypericumperforatum), calendula (Calendula officinalis), comfrey(Symphytum officinale), and tea tree oil (Melaleucaspp.). Supplementing the diet with vitamin C, vitamin E, andzinc also is beneficial for wound healing.
Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent upon the degree of theburn, the amount of body surface covered, whether criti-cal body parts were affected, any additional injuries orcomplications like infection, and the promptness of med-ical treatment. Minor burns may heal in five to 10 dayswith no scarring. Moderate burns may heal in 10-14 daysand may leave scarring. Critical or major burns takemore than 14 days to heal and will leave significant scar-ring. Scar tissue may limit mobility and functionality, butphysical therapy may overcome these limitations. Insome cases, additional surgery may be advisable toremove scar tissue and restore appearance.
Prevention
Burns are commonly received in residential fires.Properly placed and working smoke detectors in combi-nation with rapid evacuation plans will minimize a per-son’s exposure to smoke and flames in the event of a fire.Children must be taught never to play with matches,lighters, fireworks, gasoline, and cleaning fluids.Burns by scalding with hot water or other liquidsmay be prevented by setting the water heater thermostatno higher than 120°F (49°C), checking the temperatureof bath water before getting into the tub, and turning pothandles on the stove out of the reach of children. Careshould be used when removing covers from pans of

Care should be exercised around stoves,space heaters, irons, and curling irons.Sunburns may be avoided by the liberal use of a sun-screen containing either an opaque active ingredient suchas zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or a nonopaque activeingredient such as PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) orbenzophenone. Hats, loose clothing, and umbrellas alsoprovide protection, especially between 10

Bursitis
Definition
Bursitis is the painful inflammation of the bursa, apadlike sac found in areas subject to friction. Bursaecushion the movement between the bones, tendons andmuscles near the joints. Bursitis is most often caused byrepetitive movement and is known by several commonnames including weaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, andminer’s elbow, depending on the affected individual’soccupation and area of injury.Description
There are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual-ly bursae are present from birth, but they may form inresponse to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a smallamount of synovial fluid,a clear liquid that acts as alubricant. Inflammation causes painon movement. Themost common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder(subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecranon),hips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes. Theaffected area may be referred to as “frozen,” becausemovement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae,and all can become inflamed with overuse.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of bursitis is repeatedphysical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason.It can also be caused by trauma,rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and acute or chronic infection.Pain and tenderness are common symptoms. If theaffected joint is close to the skin, as with the shoulder,knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and redness areseen and the area may feel warm to the touch. The bursaearound the hip joint are deeper, and swelling is not obvi-ous. Movement may be limited and is painful. In theshoulder, it may be difficult to raise the arm out from theside of the body. Putting on a jacket or combing the hairbecomes a troublesome activity.In acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; withchronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movementreappear after exerciseor strain.
Diagnosis
When a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical examinationis needed to determine what type of move-ment is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bur-sitis will not show up on x-rays, although sometimesthere are also calcium deposits in the joint that can beseen. Inserting a thin needle into the affected bursa andremoving (aspirating) some of the synovial fluid forexamination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases,the fluid will not be clear. It can be tested for the pres-ence of microorganisms, which would indicate an infec-tion, and crystals, which could indicate gout. In instanceswhere the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drugthat numbs the area) is injected into the painful spot. Ifthe discomfort stops temporarily, then bursitis is proba-bly the correct diagnosis.
Treatment
Conservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec-tive. The application of heat, rest, and immobilizationof
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 620BursitisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 620the affected joint area is the first step. A sling can be usedfor a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip problems.The patient can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs(NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofin, and naproxen.They can be obtained without a prescription and relievethe pain and inflammation. Once the pain decreases,exercises of the affected area can begin. If the nearbymuscles have become weak because of the disease orprolonged immobility, then exercises to build strengthand improve movement are best. A doctor or physicaltherapist can prescribe an effective regimen.If the bursitis is related to an inflammatory conditionlike arthritis or gout, then management of that disease isneeded to control the bursitis.When bursitis does not respond to conservativetreatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor-ticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can bring imme-diate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid is a hormonalsubstance that is the most effective drug for reducinginflammation. The drug is mixed with a local anestheticand works on the joint within five minutes. Usually oneinjection is all that is needed.Surgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per-formed in extreme cases.If the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi-tional treatment is needed. Septicbursitis is caused by thepresence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ-cus aureus.This is confirmed by examining a sample ofthe fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi- oticstaken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein(intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained byneedle two or three times over the first week of treatment.When a patient has such a serious infection, there may beunderlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes,or an inefficient immune system caused by humanimmunodeficiencyvirus infection (HIV).
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments take into consideration therole of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of calciumby the body, magnesium deficiency, and food allergies may have a role. Diet changes and vitamin supplementsmay be helpful. The use of herbs,homeopathy,aro- matherapy, and hydrotherapycan help relieve symp-toms. Ginger is useful in reducing inflammation.Acupuncturehas been proven effective in treating hipand shoulder pain caused by bursitis and other condi-tions. Other therapies that deal effectively with muscu-loskeletal problems (relating to the muscles and skele-ton), may also be helpful, such as body work, magnetic field therapy,naturopathic medicine,chiropractic, and applied kinesiology.KEY TERMS
Arthritis—Inflammation of a joint that may lead tochanges in the joint’s structure. It causes pain andswelling. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic diseasethat leads to crippling deformities.Diabetes mellitus—A metabolic disease causedby a deficiency of insulin, which is essential toprocess carbohydrates in the body.Gout—A hereditary metabolic disease that is aform of arthritis and causes inflammation of thejoints. It is more common in men.Inflammation—The reaction of tissue to injury.Kinesiology—The science or study of movement.
Prognosis
Bursitis usually responds well to treatment, but itmay develop into a chronic condition if the underlyingcause is not corrected.
Prevention
Aggravating factors should be eliminated to preventbursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a movementthat triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing exer-cises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will alsohelp. When doing repetitive tasks, frequent breaks shouldbe taken and the activity should be alternated with othersusing different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, itis a good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting andfoam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the elbows,kneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a long period oftime should be avoided. Not wearing high heels can helpprevent bursitis in the heel, as can changing to new run-ning shoes as soon as the old ones are worn out.Resources

Byssinosis
Definition
Byssinosis is a chronic, asthma-like narrowing of theairways. Also called brown lung disease, byssinosis resultsfrom inhaling particles of cotton, flax, hemp, or jute.
Description
Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as asource of respiratory disease more than 300 years ago,byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational haz-ard for textile workers for less than 50 years. More than800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-makingindustries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti-cles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills thatmanufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant riskof dying of this disease.In the United States, byssinosis is almost completelylimited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. Morethan 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi-nosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of thepeople whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in thetextile-producing regions of North and South Carolina.
Causes and symptoms
Wheezing,shortness of breath, and a feeling oftightness in the chest occur occasionally during the earlystages of the disease. Symptoms are usually more pro-nounced when returning to work after a weekend, holi-day, or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reac-customed to the environment.As many as 25% of workers with byssinosis havesymptoms that continue or recur throughout the work-week. More severe breathing problems seem to resultboth from exposure to high levels of dust and fromlonger dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettessuffer the most severe impairment.Diagnosis
Tests that detect decreasing lung capacity during theworkday are used to diagnose byssinosis. Obstructivepatterns are likely in patients who have had recurrentsymptoms for more than 10 years.
Treatment
Therapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses onreversing airway narrowing. Antihistaminesmay be pre-scribed to reduce tightness in the chest. Bronchodilators(drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve airflow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form.Reducing exposure is essential. Any worker who hassymptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathingshould transfer to a less-contaminated area.
Prognosis
Smoking, impaired lung function, and a history ofrespiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of devel-oping byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patientswheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis. It does not lead to permanently disabling lung disease.
Prevention
Eliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest wayto prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improvingventilation, and employing wetting procedures are verysuccessful methods of controlling dust levels to preventbyssinosis. Protective equipment required during certainprocedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami-nation that exceed the current United States standard forcotton dust exposure.Resources
