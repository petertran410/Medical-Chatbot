PREFACE  
 
 
The Bachelor programs of the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) were among the first 
programs at International University since its foundation in 2003. SCSE initially had an Information 
Technology  major which consisted of t wo specializations nam ely Network Engineering and Computer 
Engineering. The s econd -year students could choose to specialize in their preferred major before they started 
their third year.  
Every year, we collect feedback from stakeholders (graduates, alumni, employers, and facul ty) about program 
objectives, learning outcomes, and curriculum in the questionnaire surveys .  Based on the received feedback, 
the programs are reviewed and justified by the School’s Academic Committee. The School’s Dean and secretary 
will then report to O UAA the changes in the curriculums if any. The following table  lists the curriculum 
amendments from 201 9.

a) Awarding body/institution: International University HCMC   
b) Teaching institution: School of Computer Science and Engineering  
c) Accreditation:  
Institutional level: MOET (2016), AUN (2018)  
 
6. TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH  
The program consist s of 5 modules  
Module  Denomination  Type of subject  
Module I  Basic training module  Compulsory  
Module II  Training module common to the 
Information Technology degree  Compulsory  
Module III  Specific training module for 
Network Engineering/Computer 
Engineering and electives  Compulsory  
Module IV  Essential skill training   Compulsory  
Module V  Module of supervised in -
company internships and Thesis  Compulsory external 
internships  
 
All the subjects in the modules are taught entirely in English except 5 courses (Philosophy 
Marx - Lenin, Marxist – Leninist Political Economy, History of Vietnamese Communist Party, 
and Ho Chi Minh Thought’s, Scientific Socialism). Each student, regardless of their 
specializati on, is required to take 8 credits in English to test the background. This guarantees that the students receive a minimum of credits in a second language, in this case, English which 
is essential for exercising their study and profession. Students must pass  the English 
proficiency test with scores of TOEFL iBT  61 or IELTS 5.5 to meet one of the general 
graduation requirements.  
The curriculum also includes political subjects which are compulsory in Vietnam, such as 
Marxist -Leninist Philosophy, Marxist –Lenini st Political Economy, Scientific Socialism, 
History of Vietnamese Communist Party and Ho Chi Minh’s Thoughts.  
The total workload per semester is about 18 credits on average. The maximum number of 
credits a student can take a semester is 24 credits, and the minimum credit is 12. According to 
IU’s academic regulation, each credit is equivalent to 15 hours in -class study and 30 hours of 
self-study . 
The exams are scheduled to avoid overlapping, distributing them along the exam period. 
Additionally, assessmen ts based on tests, projects, oral presentations, etc . are used to test 
students’ understanding during the course.  
The school management board reviews and analyses the volume of students' work in the year 
to avoid peaks due to the practice and exam time of a large number of duplicated exam subjects.  
Lectures for each course are scheduled weekly and student workload is distributed evenly over 
the semester. Each course’s syllabus explicitly specifies the expected workload.  
Teaching methods are diverse with man y forms of promoting the positivity, initiative and 
creativity of learners including such as: group work, field trips, essays, projects, 
presentations.... to achieve the expected learning outcomes. Most of the modules use the group 
work method to help lear ners achieve the learning outcome, essays, projects and project -based 
teaching methods.  Moreover, students are encouraged to join in student scientific research 
projects with their supervisors.   
In the context of COVID -19, faculty members have quickly adapted and proficiently used 
online teaching methods and tools.  Lectures were conducted via Zoom and Microsoft Teams. 
Lecturers also used Blackboard to provide students with class materials, quizzes and tests. 
Overall, lecturers can provide multi media resources to support various online learning 
activities. Students can ask questions, self -check and self -evaluate their study progres s, which 
trains learners' ability to self -study and lifelong learning.  
7. STUDENT ASSESSMENT  
To assess student learnin g, different forms of assessment are specified in every course. They 
include midterm exams, final exams, labs, quizzes, home assignments and project 
presentations. The criteria to assess students’ performance are clearly stated in the assessment 
plan of ea ch course syllabus. At the beginning of the course, the lecturer informs the 
assessment criteria of the student’s progress toward the course learning outcomes. Students 
and teaching staff can find everything related to the course specification and assessme nt criteria 
by looking in the Program specification that was published on the School/Department website 
as well as apparently shown in each syllabus in the first session of the new class . 
The examination dates and times for each department and changes can be found on the Edusoft 
website. Therefore, the exam schedule is always up -to-date.  Stude nts who have enrolled as attending or students who have enrolled as non -attending due 
to, for example, student exchange have the right to take part in examinations. The aim is to 
provide students who have been absent due to illness, military service, maternity or parental 
leave, or studies abroad the same rights upon their return as they had when they left. The rights 
shall remain in force until the end of the followi ng semester .

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be considered 
critically is stated clearly and 
described comprehensively, 
delivering all relevant 
information necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a coherent analysis 
or synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are subject to 
questioning.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with some 
interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically and 
methodically) analyzes own and 
others' assumptions and 
carefully evaluates the relevance 
of contexts when presenting a 
position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into account 
the complexities of an issue. 
Limits of position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) are 
acknowledged. Others' points of 
view are synthesized within 
position (perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically tied 
to a range of information, 
including opposing 
viewpoints; related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressive ness) detract from 
the understandability of the 
presentation, and speaker 
appears uncomfortable.  
Supporting Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis that 
significantly supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials

statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on  the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not explicitly 
stated in the presentation.

  4 3 2 1 
Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be considered 
critically is stated clearly and 
described comprehensively, 
delivering all relevant 
information necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from  
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a coherent analysis 
or synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are subject to 
questioning.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with some 
interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically and 
methodically) analyzes own and 
others' assumptions and 
carefully evaluates the relevance 
of contexts when presenting a 
position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into account 
the complexities of an issue. 
Limits of position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) are 
acknowledged. Others' points of 
view are synthesized within 
position (perspective , thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically tied 
to a range of information, 
including opposing 
viewpoints; related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be considered 
critically is stated clearly and 
described comprehensively, 
delivering all relevant 
information necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
underst anding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered cr itically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a coherent analysis 
or synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are subject to 
questioning.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with some 
interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any i nterpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically and 
methodically) analyzes own and 
others' assumptions and 
carefully evaluates the relevance 
of contexts when presenting a 
position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into account 
the complexities of an issue. 
Limits of position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) are 
acknowledged. Others' points of 
view are synthesized within 
position (perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(pers pective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  6 
 Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically tied 
to a range of information, 
including opposing 
viewpoints; related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation is 
appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation.

presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesti ng, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye

presentation 
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressive ness) detract from 
the understandability of the 
presentation, and speaker 
appears uncomfortable.  
Supporting Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis that 
significantly supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials

Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering all 
relevant information necessary 
for full understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from  
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account  the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable and is skillful 
and makes the content of 
the presentation cohesive.  Organizational pattern

and transitions) is not 
observable within the 
presentation.  
Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation .

supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on

Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly state d in the 
presentation.

Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent

Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of

Course objectives  This course is designed to introduce engineering students to the 
concepts, theory and practice of engineering ethics. It will allow 
students to expl ore the relationship between ethics and engineering and 
apply classical moral theory and decision making to engineering issues 
encountered in academic and professional careers. Our society places a 
great deal of responsibility on its professionals and requ ires that they 
conduct themselves in a manner fitting to the place of prominence 
accorded to them by the community. Studying and understanding 
professional ethics is as much a part of your development as an engineer 
as is the study of higher order mathemat ics You must be able to broaden 
your mind and be open to society's ever changing fact that you may not 
always agree; therefore, we will be working in teams on majority of the 
character. It is important that you learn to share ideas and concepts 
regardless of the assignments in this course.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering all 
relevant information necessary 
for full understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unk nown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints  of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Informati on is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hyp othesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are identified 
clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outc omes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

moving from room to room , and individual questions to lecturers after the class , all mean that about 60 minutes should 
be counted.  
Course  
objectives  There are a number of objectives embedded in various teaching activities in 
Listening AE1 course:  
Pre-listening activities: aim to activate students’ current knowledge of the topic, 
and to provide them with lecture language and effective strategies in listening and  
note-taking to prepare themselves for the coming lecture. These activities include 
reading (this can be done before class meetings), discussing and reviewing what 
they have learned from the reading.  
While -listening and post -listening activities: aim to enable students to put their 
newly activated knowledge and acquired strategies into work by taking notes on 
the lecture, using the outline given by the teacher or prepa red by themselves. 
They are later on asked to assess their understanding based on their notes and 
discuss them with their classmates. Finally, as an optional activity, depending on 
time and students’ needs, students are asked to summarize the lecture.  
Follow-up activities: students are required to discuss the lecture topic and to 
prepare arguments for or against the topic in the debate. The purpose is to 
enhance students’ comprehension of the lecture, and to allow them to put their 
acquired academic languag e into practice, and to experience the atmosphere of a 
university lecture class.

25% - 40% The score  is deducted  by 50%  
Over  40% The score is  0. 
Notes:  Part of the test is marked  as it is if no plagiarism  is detected.  Students

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ probl em to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to deve lop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as  
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assump tions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective , thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority ord er.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desir ed 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently

observable within the 
presentation.  Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation . 
Language in presentation

Delivery  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesting, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation 
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) detract 
from the understandability 
of the presentation, and 
speaker appears 
uncomfortable.  
Supporting 
Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishe s the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics,

supports t he presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analy sis that partially 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient supporting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make ref erence 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be

stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be

stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from  
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective , thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective,

(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints;

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered criticall y is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation.  
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothes is). Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective,

acknowle dges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and

identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is

view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis.

and others' assumptions and 
carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant 
contexts when 
presenting a position. 
May be more aware of 
others' assumptions 
than one's own (or vice 
versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position

Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically tied 
to a range of information, 
including opposing 
viewpoints; related 
outcomes (consequences 
and implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(conse quences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering all 
relevant information necessary 
for full understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with  enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting  a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertio ns as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities o f an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stat ed, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints;

and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a

Student's position 
(perspective,

account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged.

discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and

tied to information 
(because information is

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering all 
relevant information necessary 
for full understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be

Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, amb iguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluat ion 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts a re taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Beg ins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points  of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable and is skillful 
and makes the content of 
the presentation cohesive.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable within the  
presentation.  Organizational pattern

and transitions) is 
intermittently observable 
within the presentation.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced

and transitions) is not 
observable within the 
presentation.  
Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to 
audience.  Language choices are

presentation. Language in 
presentation is 
appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
unclear and minimally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is not appropriate to 
audience.  
Delivery  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesti ng, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation 
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressive ness) detract 
from the understandability 
of the presentation, and 
speaker appears 
uncomfortable.  
Supporting 
Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that generally 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that partially 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient supporting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibi lity/ 
authority on the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by

Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation.  
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothes is). Specific position 
(perspective,

outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with  enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting  a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertio ns as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities o f an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stat ed, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to informat ion 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable and is skillful 
and makes the content of 
the presentation cohesive.  Organizational pattern 
(specific i ntroduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable within the 
presentation.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitio ns) is 
intermittently observable 
within the presentation.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is not 
observable within the 
presentation.  
Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in present ation 
is appropriate to 
audience.  Language choices are 
mundane and 
commonplace and 
partially support the 
effectiveness of the 
presentation. Language in 
presentation is 
appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
unclear and minimally 
support the effectiv eness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is not appropriate to 
audience.  
Delivery  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesting, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation  
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) detract 
from the understandability 
of the presentation, and 
speaker appears 
uncomfortable.  
Supporting 
Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the present er's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that generally 
supports the presentati on 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that partially 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient supporting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.  Source: Association of American Colleges and Universities

relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that generally 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that partially 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient suppo rting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on  the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
underst anding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered cr itically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any i nterpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within po sition 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(pers pective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assump tions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective , thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within

Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority ord er.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering all 
relevant information necessary 
for full understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from  
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. Viewpoints 
of experts are taken as 
fact, without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account  the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are identified 
clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable and is skillful 
and makes the content of 
the presentation cohesive.  Organizational pattern

observable within the 
presentation.  
Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation

Delivery  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesti ng, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation 
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressive ness) detract 
from the understandability 
of the presentation, and 
speaker appears 
uncomfortable.  
Supporting Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials

or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient suppo rting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on  the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.  Source: Association of American Colleges and Universities

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coher ent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account  the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.  Source: Association of American Colleges and Universities

Organization  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable and is skillful 
and makes the content of 
the presentation cohesive.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is clearly 
and consistently 
observable within the  
presentation.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is 
intermittently observable 
within the presentation.  Organizational pattern 
(specific introduction and 
conclusion, sequenced 
material within the body, 
and transitions) is not 
observable within the 
presentation.  
Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to 
audience.  Language choices are 
mundane and 
commonplace and 
partially support the 
effectiveness of the 
presentation. Language in 
presentation is 
appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
unclear and minimally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is not appropriate to 
audience.  
Delivery  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation compelling, 
and speaker appears 
polished and confident.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesti ng, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation 
understandable, and 
speaker appears tentative.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye 
contact, and vocal 
expressive ness) detract 
from the understandability 
of the presentation, and 
speaker appears 
uncomfortable.  
Supporting 
Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make 
appropriate reference to 
information or analysis 
that significantly supports 
the presentation or 
establishes the presenter's 
credibility/ authority on 
the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that generally 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations 
from relevant authorities) 
make appropriate 
reference to information 
or analysis that partially 
supports the presentation 
or establishes the 
presenter's credibility/ 
authority on the topic.  Insufficient suppo rting 
materials (explanations, 
examples, illustrations, 
statistics, analogies, 
quotations from relevant 
authorities) make reference 
to information or analysis 
that minimally supports the 
presentation or establishes 
the presenter's credibility/ 
authority on  the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from  
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts whe n 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes lab els 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account  the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unk nown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints  of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Informati on is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hyp othesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outc omes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

authority on the topic.  
Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the 
presentation.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered criticall y is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thoroughly.  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation.  
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without question.  
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of present 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothes is). Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) takes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowle dges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, including 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(conseq uences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsis tently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.

Explanation of 
issues  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is stated 
clearly and described 
comprehensively, delivering 
all relevant information 
necessary for full 
understanding.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated, described, and 
clarified so that 
understanding is not 
seriously impeded by 
omissions.  Issue/ problem to b e 
considered critically is 
stated but description 
leaves some terms 
undefined, ambiguities 
unexplored, boundaries 
undetermined, and/ or 
backgrounds unknown.  Issue/ problem to be 
considered critically is 
stated without 
clarification or 
description.  
Evidence  
Selecting and using 
information to 
investigate a point of 
view or conclusion  Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation to 
develop a comprehensive 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
questioned thorough ly. Information is taken from 
source(s) with enough 
interpretation/ evaluation 
to develop a coherent 
analysis or synthesis. 
Viewpoints of experts are 
subject to questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) with 
some interpretation/ 
evaluation, but not 
enough to develop a 
coherent analysis or 
synthesis. Viewpoints of 
experts are taken as 
mostly fact, with little 
questioning.  Information is taken 
from source(s) without 
any interpretation/ 
evaluation. 
Viewpoints of experts 
are taken as fact, 
without questi on. 
Influence of context 
and assumptions  Thoroughly (systematically 
and methodically) analyzes 
own and others' assumptions 
and carefully evaluates the 
relevance of contexts when 
presenting a position.  Identifies own and others' 
assumptions and several 
relevant contexts when 
presenting a position.  Questions some 
assumptions. Identifies 
several relevant contexts 
when presenting a 
position. May be more 
aware of others' 
assumptions than one's 
own (or vice versa).  Shows an emerging 
awareness of prese nt 
assumptions 
(sometimes labels 
assertions as 
assumptions). Begins 
to identify some 
contexts when 
presenting a position.  
Student's position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis)  Specific position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis) is 
imaginative, taking into 
account the complexities of an 
issue. Limits of position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) are acknowledged. 
Others' points of view are 
synthesized within position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, 
thesis/hypothesis) t akes 
into account the 
complexities of an issue. 
Others' points of view are 
acknowledged within 
position (perspective, 
thesis/ hypothesis).  Specific position 
(perspective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) 
acknowledges different 
sides of an issue.  Specific position 
(pers pective, thesis/ 
hypothesis) is stated, 
but is simplistic and 
obvious.  
Conclusions and 
related outcomes 
(implications and 
consequences)  Conclusions and related 
outcomes (consequences and 
implications) are logical and 
reflect student’s informed 
evaluation and ability to place 
evidence and perspectives 
discussed in priority order.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to a range of 
information, incl uding 
opposing viewpoints; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is logically 
tied to information 
(because information is 
chosen to fit the desired 
conclusion); some 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implicati ons) are 
identified clearly.  Conclusion is 
inconsistently tied to 
some of the 
information discussed; 
related outcomes 
(consequences and 
implications) are 
oversimplified.  Source: Association of American Colleges and Universities

Language  Language choices are 
imaginative, memorable, 
and compelling, and 
enhance the effectiveness 
of the presentation. 
Language in presentation 
is appropriate to audience.  Language choices are 
thoughtful and generally 
support the effectiveness 
of the presentation.

contact, and vocal 
expressiveness) make the 
presentation interesti ng, 
and speaker appears 
comfortable.  Delivery techniques 
(posture, gesture, eye

Supporting 
Material  A variety of types of 
supporting materials 
(explanations, examples, 
illustrations, statistics, 
analogies, quotations from 
relevant authorities) make

Central Message  Central message is 
compelling (precisely 
stated, appropriately 
repeated, memorable, and 
strongly supported.)  Central message is clear 
and consistent with the 
supporting material.  Central message is 
basically understandable 
but is not often repeated 
and is not memorable.  Central message can be 
deduced but is not 
explicitly stated in the

Special Study of the Field  
Course objectives  Dissertations are industrial projects designed to ensure that students have mastered 
their subjects in the program. All projects are based on "real projects" provided by 
the industry to students to develop skills and apply knowledge gained from all 
courses throughout the program. Students will work independently to develop 
requirements, design, implement and provide solutio ns to business problems. 
Students can follow any appropriate process model, must self -manage the project, 
follow all appropriate project management techniques. The success of the project is 
largely determined by whether the student adequately solves the cl ient's problem.  
Students will provide the final product with all artifacts that match the process model 
being used (e.g. project plan, technical requirements, system architecture, design 
documentation, test plan, source code and installed software products ).

12. ACADEMIC REGULATION  
The total workload per semester is about 18 credits on average. The maximum number of 
credits a student can take a semester is 24 credits, and the minimum credit is 12. According to 
IU’s academic regulation, each credit is equivalent to 15 hours in -class s tudy and 30 hours of 
self-study.  
 University’s policy on fraud, plagiarism,  and academic integrity  
According to IU Policy, a fraud policy includes these key elements:  
• An explicit definition of actions that are deemed to be fraudulent  
• Allocation of respon sibilities for the overall management of fraud  
• A statement that all appropriate measures to deter fraud will be taken  
• The formal procedures that employees should follow if a fraud is suspected  
• Notification that all instances of suspected fraud will be inve stigated and reported to 
the appropriate authorities  
• An unequivocal statement that all fraud offenders will be prosecuted and that the police 
will be assisted in any investigation that is required  
• A statement that all efforts will be made to recover wrongf ully obtained assets from 
fraudsters  
• Encouragement to employees to report any suspicion of fraud  
At IU, plagiarism is the representation of others’ ideas as one’s own without giving proper 
attribution to the original author or authors. Plagiarism occurs wh en a student copies direct 
phrases from a text (e.g., books, journals, and internet) and does not provide quotation marks, 
paraphrases or summarizes those ideas without giving credit to the author or authors. In all 
cases, if such information is not proper ly and accurately documented with appropriate credits 
given, then the student has committed plagiarism. Sometimes the act of plagiarizing can be 
purely unintentional . 
The University has also established a system for managing intellectual property (IP). The  
system includes:  
• Promulgating regulations on managing intellectual assets, including intellectual 
property in 2012.  
• Establishing a Unit of Intellectual Asset Management . 
• Having relevant staff officially trained  
• Setting up a Turnitin system . 
IU has issued a regulation on managing intellectual assets that are designed in compliance with 
the regulations promulgated by VNUHCM . In addition, other regulations and documents that 
also take IP into account include the regulation   of professional ethics in t eaching and research, 
R&D contracts,  and forms (e.g., requests for human blood plasma, acknowledgment of a 
publication) . 
IU has invested in setting up the Turnitin system to check plagiarism for research articles and 
theses. A student’s thesis, prior to be ing submitted to schools and departments, must be 
submitted to Turnitin. If the percentage of similarity between the work and other works is less 
than 20%, that thesis is accepted to be submitted to the schools and departments for defense. 
The Turnitin rep ort is required to be affixed to the final version of the thesis. This procedure 
ensures the students and staff respect the copyright of others’ works . 
Academic Integrity is an important basic responsibility that is taken by all students in higher 
educatio n. Members of the University Community are obliged to report all cases to the 
appropriate faculty, including the Dean or Department Chair.  A copy of this policy is available to all students and faculty by looking at the University 
website. A reference to t his policy is provided on every course syllabus within the 
School/Department . 
All faculty members are aware of and have provided input to the Academic Integrity Policy. 
As mentioned above, information pertaining to academic integrity is provided on all course 
syllabus for both online and on -campus courses . Faculty are encouraged to express both orally 
and in written form the importance of academic integrity and to give the students clear 
guidelines and expectations of what is acceptable behavior  regardin g the use of someone else's 
work.  
Students must also take on the responsibility of academic integrity by promoting work that is 
original in content and properly referenced. Violations of academic integrity include, but are 
not limited to, cheating and plag iarism of academic assignments (i.e., research papers, 
critiques, presentations, and book/journal reviews). Cheating on exams is also a serious 
violation and is in violation of this policy. Faculty members that suspect academic dishonesty 
are expected to r eport violations to the department chair within 5 calendar days of the 
occurrence.  
This policy in hand provides the student with a fair procedure for due process if a charge is 
brought to a student's attention from a faculty member .
